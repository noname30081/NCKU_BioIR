The patient had had Alzheimer's type dementia for 3 years. The COVID-19 infection took a mild course in accordance with the RKI guidelines. This was followed by a manic syndrome according to the ICD-10 with a clearly elevated mood, increased drive and behavior that occured for the first time in the patient's life.",alzheimer
34974434,Telemedicine in French Memory Clinics During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,J Alzheimers Dis,"This multicenter study was conducted in French memory clinics during the first COVID-2019 lockdown (March-May 2020). The objective was to evaluate the effect of a telemedicine consultation on treatment modification in dementia care. Among 874 patients who had a telemedicine consultation, 103 (10.7%) had treatment modifications, in particular those living with a relative or diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. A control group of patients referred March-May 2019 was also included. Treatment modification rate was similar between periods with an adjusted percentage difference of -4% (p = 0.27). Telemedicine consultations allowed treatment modifications with only a minor short-term negative impact on therapeutic strategies.",alzheimer
34973027,Cognitive Enhancement Through Mathematical Problem-Solving.,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Nowadays, modern lifestyle along with the ever-growing technological and scientific advancement, especially in developed countries, has led to a significant increase of the middle age and elderly population. As a consequence, a substantial rise in neurodegenerative diseases has been reported, such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and other types of dementia. The aim of this paper is to study the impact of mathematical problem-solving on cognitive enhancement of adults. Moreover, the possible applicability of mathematical problem-solving as part of a treatment in cases of adults suffering from different levels of cognitive decline due to neurodegenerative diseases has been taken into consideration. For the needs of this study, a qualitative research was conducted in a sample of 16 participants, in order to confirm the effect of the mathematical problem-solving process on their cognition and its reinforcement, as stated by the participants. The results of this research, as interpreted, indicate a positive effect of mathematical problem-solving on adult cognition and on cognitive processes in general. Nonetheless, there are certain limitations to this research, deriving from its nature, while others derive from the measures enforced during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Therefore, this chapter suggests that a more thorough quantitative research should be conducted in order to specifically measure the magnitude, as well as the time span of the impact of mathematical problem-solving on adult cognitive enhancement. Moreover, it is proposed that future studies should concentrate on the usefulness of mathematical problem-solving as a component in both invasive and noninvasive cognitive treatments used to cure or alleviate the aforementioned cognitive impairments.",alzheimer
34971298,Being a frail older person at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, frail older individuals have been identified as a particularly vulnerable group for poor health outcomes, including cognitive decline and dementia. We aimed to reflect on the interaction between frailty and COVID-19 with regards to health consequences. METHOD: Using a rapid literature review approach, we aimed to identify what it means to be a frail older individual in the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of three different settings: community, hospitals, and nursing homes. Four researchers from 4 countries (Ireland, France, Germany, and Brazil) reviewed articles from the MEDLINE database and grey literature including public policy briefs from their countries. RESULTS: In the community, some governments advised to practice ""cocooning"", i.e. stay-at-home-orders for older individuals. This brought unprecedented restrictions to lifestyles, leading to a potential frailty cascade among older adults. Social frailty likely caused mental ill-health, cognitive and functional decline, increasing the risk for dementia. In hospitals, frailty affected from disease onset to survivorship. The clinical presentation was rather atypical, and the biological findings were more heterogenous. Some resource allocation strategies based on the Clinical Frailty Scale remained questionable and should take into account patients' and carers' needs. A quarter of patients had increased care needs at discharge. However, availability of rehabilitation and support services in the community has been reduced. Frail older adults living in nursing homes were the most vulnerable group. Isolating residents and limiting the spread of COVID-19 was a key difficulty. Reduced visits from relatives, cancelled physical activities, and lack of social engagement worsened cognitive, behavioral, and physical conditions of the residents. There were also positive aspects such as the boom of digital literacy and telemedicine and a renewed debate on age and ageing. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic spotlights the ageing population that is rapidly growing worldwide. Prolonged lifestyle restrictions during the pandemic led to poor health outcomes in frail older individuals, including cognitive decline and dementia. Lessons learned from how frail older individuals are getting through the pandemic provide a unique chance to improve health outcomes, community and health services and how we want to live as ageing societies.",alzheimer
34971296,Caring for residents with dementia during a COVID-19 outbreak in a long-term care home.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Although there have been considerable public concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on residents living in long-term care homes, much less attention has focused on lessons learned from staff experiences about caring for people with dementia during outbreaks. The outbreaks added significant additional stress to the nursing workforce, which has historically experienced high turnover, chronic staffing shortages, and increased burnout in long-term care settings. We conducted focus groups (n=20) and individual interviews (n=10) to investigate critical challenges, experiences, and support needed for frontline staff in a long-term care home in British Columbia, Canada. A total of 30 staff in multiple disciplines participated in the study. They included Registered Nurses, Licenced Practical Nurses, care staff, recreational staff, and unit clerks. We applied qualitative thematic analysis and identified four themes: (a) I am proud, (b) we become stronger, (c) I am nervous (d) the vaccine helps. The frontline staff's voices provided a detailed description of their emotional experiences, creative coping strategies and positive stories about caring for the most vulnerable population in extraordinary situations. In our poster, lessons learned and implications for future research and practice will be explored and discussed.",alzheimer
34971293,Addressing dementia challenges through international networks: Evidence from the Latin American and Caribbean Consortium on Dementia (LAC-CD).,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: LAC-CD has recently reported that challenges faced by LAC countries are very similar to those experienced by HIC, and that regional networks will be needed to bridge gaps. ReDLat is a US-LAC multi-partner consortium aimed at expanding dementia research in LAC. The UK-Latin America Brain Connectivity Research Network (UL-BCRN) focuses on developing new affordable EEG-based biomarkers for dementia. The Language and Brain Health Network (LBHN) integrate international multidisciplinary efforts to reveal linguistic markers of neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: ReDLat is collecting genomic, neuroimaging, clinical, cognitive, and socioeconomic data from a first-in-class cohort anchored in six LAC (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru) and will compare these to US data (> 4200 participants, including 2100 controls, 1050 AD patients, and 1050 FTD patients). The 5-year project will develop innovative, harmonized, and cross-nation approaches on two of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). The UL-BCRN currently links seven EEG labs from Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Brazil and the UK. The network's vision is to forge strong relationships between labs through which new methodologies, EEG plus multidimensional datasets, and experience will be developed and shared. The LBHN will analyze speech samples from massive AD, FTD, and control cohorts across LAC, Spain, and the US. This effort aims to identify low-cost disease-specific markers in diverse Latino and English-speaking patients. RESULTS: ReDLat will aims to reveal unique risk factors for AD and FTD in LAC compared to US populations. Data collection strategies have been adapted to face the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. The UL-BCRN has now standardised recording protocols across LAC and UK labs and is collecting data from longitudinal cohorts of patients at risk of dementia relying on novel culture-free cognitive paradigms. Preliminary LBHN data shows that, automated speech analyses can identify Latinos with AD and FTD, with good generalization across socio-biological profiles, dialects, and languages. CONCLUSION: By broadening our understanding of dementia phenotypes, risk factors, and affordable diagnostic approaches in LAC, adding new evidence on variability across HIC and LMIC, the above networks will contribute unique knowledge that will help enhance future global dementia strategies.",alzheimer
34971289,Telehealth outreach programming in the Pacific island of Guam: Providing access to dementia care support services during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to heightened levels of isolation and loneliness for millions of individuals and families worldwide, resulting in adverse health and mental health outcomes. Persons with dementia and their family caregivers are particularly vulnerable due to the deleterious impact of social isolation on both dementia symptoms and caregiver burden. One of the greatest challenges for dementia patients has been accessing dementia care services during COVID-19 lockdowns. In the Pacific island of Guam, the pandemic quickly led to the closure of senior centers, adult day care centers, family caregiver support programs, and other social services for older adults and their families in March 2020. As a result, persons with dementia suddenly found themselves isolated at home and dependent upon family members to provide round-the-clock care. This presentation will describe the development of an innovative telehealth outreach program that was launched in Guam in the summer of 2020, three months after the first COVID-19 case had appeared on the island. The program was designed to provide improved access to social support and specialized community services for persons with dementia and their family caregivers. There are four components: (1) virtual family caregiver support groups where participants can share the stresses and challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia with others who are going through similar experiences; (2) virtual presentation and consultation sessions led by dementia care specialists from the community providing easy access to dementia care information and services; (3) 24/7 family caregiver support networks through mobile messaging apps to mitigate social isolation and ensure the availability of support in times of crisis; and (4) telehealth family counseling for persons with dementia and their family members employing narrative approaches that embrace the oral storytelling traditions of Pacific island cultures. The community response has been strong with approximately 50-60 family caregivers and persons with dementia participating in the program monthly. Project outcomes suggest that telehealth outreach services represent an effective and sustainable approach to connecting persons living with dementia and their family caregivers to community resources during times of isolation.",alzheimer
34971287,Dissemination of person-centered community care for mild dementia using local cooperatives in Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: To promote aging in place and improve the quality of life for persons with mild dementia during COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to support them in their community in-person approach. Therefore, person-centered community care for individual service and support in the community is an urgent priority. This study aimed to develop a person-centered community service for mild dementia patient to collaborate with local cooperatives and test its feasibility. METHODS: This study was done from March to December, 2020. The person centered community service manual was developed based on previous guidelines and studies. The manual guided person-centered assessment, tailored intervention, and outcome evaluation based on six domains; person-hood, daily life, cognitive health, physical activity, safety, and community support. The local cooperatives for community care participated to provide comprehensive needs assessment and individualized service to the community residents with mild dementia. The staff visited the patient's home and provide individual service. The feasibility study was tested with the staff and patients. RESULTS: This study found that the service was effective for initial rapport, comprehensive assessment, individualized planning, person-centered service provision, referral to community service, and outcome evaluation. However, service provider's increased workloads and the time for home visiting and completing the service were identified as barriers during pandemic period. In addition, service providers still experienced lack of knowledge and skills in enhancing safety such as precaution and social distancing. CONCLUSION: The person-centered community service can be useful to enhance the safe and sustainable community services during COVID-19 pandemics. Collaboration with local cooperatives can be the best practices through the well-designed manual.",alzheimer
34971285,Effectiveness of home-based telerehabilitation in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: A randomised controlled study.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has made it necessity that rehabilitation services are provided remotely to patients. These process required a transformation in healthcare. The aim of this study was investigate the effectiveness of the home-based online supervised exercise program in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the results of real-time supervised physical exercise telerehabilitation program in AD. METHOD: Eighteen subjects with early-middle stage of AD were randomised into 2 group as telerehabilitation group (TG; mean age: 77.7 +/- 5.29 years; 7 Female, 3 Male) and control group (CG; mean age: 78.5 +/- 7.07 years; 5 Female, 3 Male). Our primary outcome was Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), seconder outcomes were Timed Up&Go (TUG), One-leg Balance Test (OLBT), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS). The 6-week motor-cognitive dual-task exercise training was performed online and under the supervision of physiotherapist through videoconference. No physical or cognitive intervention was applied to the control group for 6 weeks. Subjects were assessed before and after the treatment. In statistical analysis, the change in the outcome scores was calculated ( = last measurement-first measurement), the difference between the groups was performed with the Mann Whitney-U Test in SPSS 22.0. Trial's protocol is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov under number NCT04606251. RESULT: There was a significant difference between TG and CG in favor of TG in MMSE, TUG, FIM and GDS (p<0,05); There was no significant difference between groups in OLBT (p>0,05). Statistical results have been showed in Table 1. No safety problem was observed during the treatment. All subjects were completed the study, there was a high adherence to treatment. CONCLUSION: Physical exercise treatment with telerehabilitation was feasible, safe and well-accepted by people with early-middle stage of AD. Online-supervised exercise program can improve cognitive function, functional mobility, independence and reduce depressive symptoms.",alzheimer
34971276,Development and dissemination of an ethical guidance and person-centred isolation care planning tool to support the care of people with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Long-term care (LTC) residents have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, both from the virus itself and the restrictions in effect for infection prevention and control. Many barriers exist in LTC to prevent the effective isolation of suspect or confirmed COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, these measures have a severe impact on the well-being of LTC residents. Our aim was to develop a guide for long-term care to address the ethical challenges associated with isolating dementia patients during the pandemic. The Dementia Isolation Toolkit (DIT) was developed by members of the research team in partnership with LTC stakeholders to address: 1) the practical challenges of isolating or quarantining people with dementia in a compassionate, safe, and effective manner; and 2) the need for ethical guidance to support decision-making regarding isolation and infection control in LTC, to prevent indecision and moral distress. To develop the DIT the team reviewed and synthesized the literature on pandemic ethics in a plain-language document, which was then reviewed by our partners and stakeholders. The final ethical guidance tool includes a discussion of the ethics around infection control measures in a pandemic, an ethical decision-making tool, and a person-centred isolation care planning tool. The ethical guidance tool has been downloaded more than 6500 times since it was published (bit.ly/dementiatoolkit), and has been disseminated internationally. The worksheets are being used during outbreaks to support care and decision-making, as well as proactively, to prepare for outbreaks by developing isolation care plans. There is a need for support for ethical decision-making in the context of a pandemic, particularly in settings such as LTC. Future studies will evaluate the implementation of the tool and its impact in addressing moral distress in health care providers in long-term care.",alzheimer
34971269,UW Project ECHO-Dementia: Implementation of a virtual clinic and telementoring program to improve dementia diagnosis and treatment in rural and under-resourced primary care settings.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Primary care providers are on the front lines of dementia care and frequently the first point of contact for individuals and families concerned about changes in memory and thinking. In addition to the challenges of managing complex medical comorbidities, primary care providers in rural or lower-resource settings often lack access to specialists, interdisciplinary teams or other programs and services to aid in diagnosis and care of individuals with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. The current project extends an existing technology-based hub and spoke model virtual clinic, Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes, University of New Mexico), to improve diagnosis and care of dementia in primary care. METHOD: The current project is an extension of work related to the Washington State Plan for Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias with implementation supported by legislative funding. The program includes an interdisciplinary expert panel (""hub"") meeting with participants (""spokes"") including primary and allied health care providers from healthcare systems, group practices, and solo practitioners. The twice-monthly virtual clinic sessions include a brief didactic followed by case-based learning in an ""all-teach, all-learn"" format emphasizing expertise and experience of spoke sites as well as the hub. Participants are provided with resources discussed during the clinic session, ongoing opportunities for consultation, and free continuing education credits. RESULTS: Launching amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the program has provided over 250 hours of education to more than 50 providers across 20 unique sites. Post session surveys indicate that the program is well-received with 2 in 3 providers indicating that they will change their practice based on learning. Surveys also demonstrate significant increases in both knowledge and confidence in dementia-specific diagnosis and care. CONCLUSION: The success of the current project demonstrates both the feasibility and benefit of leveraging technology to deliver dementia-related education to primary care providers in rural and under-resourced settings. While initially hampered by disruptions in care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased technological proficiency on the provider and systems level has appeared to be a benefit in terms of resources and comfort participating in a virtual education program to scale Dementia Capable Care in Primary Care.",alzheimer
34971266,Person-centered care for family caregivers of people living with dementia: Co-designing an education program for the healthcare workforce.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Recent research recommends the healthcare workforce receive competency-based education to identify, assess, support and partner with family-caregivers [FCGs} across the care trajectory.([1 2]) Although the risk of FCG anxiety, burden, and loneliness to FCG's wellbeing is widely documented, typically education has been targeted towards FCG's to increase their care skills rather to educate healthcare providers to support FCG's caregiving and wellbeing.([3]) OBJECTIVES: We will present the co-design process used to create a competency-based education program for the healthcare workforce that ensures a person-centered focus on FCGs and introduce our Health Workforce Caregiver-Centered Care Education focused on dementia. Co-design is the act of creating with stakeholders to ensure the results meet their needs and are usable. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: We began by coining the concept ""caregiver-centered care,"" defining it as: a collaborative working relationship between families and healthcare providers aimed at supporting FCGs in their caregiving role, decisions about services, care management, and advocacy ([4 5]) . From this definition, and working with multi-level interdisciplinary stakeholders we designed([6]) and validated([7]) a Caregiver-Centered Care Competency Framework in a Modified Delphi Process. Stakeholders (n= 101) including FCGs, health providers, policy makers, community organizations, research team, script writer, and educational designers then used effective practices for dementia education for the health workforce ([8-11]) to co-design the first or 'foundational' level of a Caregiver Centered Care education program. RESULTS: Teaching and learning resources include six competency-aligned educational modules with videos and interactive exercises that encourage reflection. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we moved the education online (caregivercare.ca). In the first two months online, November 9, 2020-January 9, 2021, 352 healthcare providers completed the education. To date, learners' qualitative evaluations have been positive, ""Very good information for professionals working with caregivers; especially relevant to homecare, geriatricians, allied health, and others working within the Seniors' Health realm. Engaging format that really evokes empathy for caregivers."" DISCUSSION: We continue to use mixed methods to evaluate the Caregiver-Centered Care Education, for acceptability and effectiveness, in five care contexts (primary, acute, home, supportive living, long-term care). CONCLUSION: We expect that our education will support caregiver-centered care in all settings providing dementia-related care.",alzheimer
34971258,Efficacy of cognitive stimulation therapy virtual program for older adults with dementia in COVID-19 isolation.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive stimulation virtual therapy (CSVT) is an evidence-based psychosocial intervention for people with mild-to-moderate dementia due to various etiological factors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of a cognitive stimulation virtual therapy CSVT program, in individuals who have vascular or Alzheimer dementia in COVID-19 isolation. METHODS: Older adults with mild vascular or Alzheimer dementia (N = 20) were assigned to one of two programs: one group (N = 10) attended during six months, two sessions per week program of the cognitive stimulation virtual therapy CSVT program, while the other, active control group (N = 10) took part in alternative activities. The following tests were applied to their primary caregivers. A short form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) and quality of life (Quality of Life (QoL) RESULTS: Compared with the active controls, the cognitive stimulation virtual therapy CSVT program showed a greater improvement in general cognitive functioning after the intervention (i.e. score increase on the IQCODE test). A trend towards improvement was also identified in short term/working memory and perceived quality of life (Quality of life (QoL) of elderly with dementia). The primary caregivers also perceived an improvement in mood, stress, anxiety and quality of sleep after the start of the virtual therapy during COVID-19 isolation. CONCLUSION: The present results support the efficacy of cognitive stimulation virtual therapy CSVT program in people with dementia during COVID-19 isolation.",alzheimer
34971256,Lessons from COVID-19 pandemic: Clinical experiences on telemedicine in patients with dementia in Iran.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: One of the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on health system has been increasing the burden on the patients with dementia and their families. Telemedicine has shown to be a solution for this vulnerable group and can be used for cognitive assessment, medication adjustment, patient referral, reduces the travel time, cost and caregiver burden. Despite the challenges in acceptance for this novel technology in the elderly (1,) it can reduce the burden of disease and increase access to specialised services. All these alongside neurologic visit could be provided with a telephone hotline or preferably video-platform tele-visit.(2) However, barriers to develop telemedicine include a lack of broadband internet access and the need for insurance coverage.(3) The American Academy of Neurology has been developed a comprehensive guideline to implement the tele-visit approach in the COVID-19 crisis with a special approach to neurological examination limitations in the patients.(4) Numerous studies evaluated this approach to assess patients including dementia.(5) Overall, the patients, caregivers, and the neurologists reported a high satisfaction rate.(6) Yaadmaan Institution for Brain, Cognition and Memory Studies with a multidisciplinary team including cognitive neurologist, psychiatrist, psychologist, geriatrician, and clinical pharmacist is the first private referral center for cognitive disorders in Iran. After starting quarantine and tight restrictions and because of too many families who were seeking help for their patients via Yaadmaan helpline, we decided to start Telemedicine method. The approach and compatible examinations have been shown in Table 2 and 3 respectively. In addition, we defined a list of serious states to avoid Telemedicine for patients referal to the hospital in Table 4. Based on our one-year experiences, it seems there are promising results in-terms of feasibility, acceptability and convenience for the patient, caregiver and physician. However, due to the emergence of this pandemic, Telemedicine and its crucial role in Iran has not yet been identified in the insurance and health system appropriately. Even though Telemedicine was started as a practical and urgent solution against COVID-19 restrictions, it is necessary to be evaluated as an alternative method for clinical evaluations of the patients with dementia in Iran in the future.",alzheimer
34971254,Assessing cognition in the era of COVID19: Do we need methods to assess cognitive function virtually?,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: With an aging population, cognitive impairment has become increasingly prevalent. Early symptoms are often missed in primary care and may progress to clinical dementia before being noticed. Screening for dementia has been a challenge. No clear guideline describes how to assess for cognition in primary care despite the robust data suggesting that early identification of dementia allows for mobilization of resources to support patients and caregivers, and there is no harm in proactive assessing cognition in older patients. In addition, most of the cognitive assessment methods requires in-person cognitive testing in primary care practices, this may be affected by situations where the in-person visitations to the physician offices are limited such as in the COVID 19 pandemic. Our study aims to access performance of in-person cognitive assessment in primary care during COVID 19 pandemic. METHODS: Cleveland Clinic implanted MiniCog as a cognitive screening tool in primary care at Cleveland Clinic Community Care (4C). Inclusion criteria are- Age 65+, Annual Wellness visit, no preexisting diagnosis of dementia, normal MiniCog in previous year. Data were registered from from January 2019 until November 2020. RESULTS: Figure 1 displays the number of MiniCog performed at 4C averaging 360 MiniCog every month. Total number of MiniCogs performed during the study period was 7126 out of which 6739 were normal (95%) and 387 were abnormal (5%). Figure 2 displays the impact of COVID 19 pandemic on in-person visits in 4C, resulting an impressive decline in cognitive assessment process leading to no cognitive testing in April and only two tests in May. CONCLUSION: Most of the cognitive assessment tools used in clinical practice requires in-person office based and are often needed to diagnose dementia. Telephonic cognitive interviews such as TICS and MoCA 5 minute protocol are available, but are difficult to administer in primary care. The substantial drop in the performance of in-person cognitive assessment during the COVID 19 pandemic raises the need of validated tools to virtually assess cognitive function and also highlights the negative impact of COVID 19 pandemic on already frail processes of assessing cognitive health of older adults in primary care.",alzheimer
34971249,Fighting social isolation of vulnerable people with dementia through remote group meetings: An experience report.,Alzheimers Dement,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION: With the COVID-19 pandemic (WHO, 2020), social distancing became a crucial means to prevent further spread of the disease (Wendy et al, 2020). This raises concerns for dementia care (Wang et al, 2020), as social distancing leads to reduced cognitive stimulation, exercise, social networking and leisure activities (Brown et al, 2020). Active participation in art has shown positive impacts on the psychosocial wellbeing of stroke survivors (Morris et al, 2019). Additionally, engaging with humor potentially improves the memory, communication and self-esteem of people with dementia (PWD) (Stevens, 2012). This study aims at reporting an innovative, interdisciplinary remote intervention targeted at groups of PWD and stroke survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. These were part of the university community outreach program Playful Living, which aims at promoting digital inclusion, quality of life and equity through artistic group activities. The project began in 2020 and consists of weekly group meetings through online platforms, with different creative practices happening each week. These include dance, gastronomy, storytelling and clowning. There are 32 participants: 13 PWD, 14 stroke survivors and 5 older adults with no diagnosis of neurological conditions. All participants were selected considering social vulnerability determinants: income, race, gender and educational background. Participants were divided into four groups, each with a fixed team (students of Speech Therapy, Psychology, Dance and Dramatic Arts) and moving members. So far, seven meetings took place. The activities have provided different opportunities for sharing memories, experiencing and expressing emotions through art. Participants reported looking forward to the meetings, with increasing participation and bonding. A major concern has been digital inclusion: stable internet access, camera and microphone management. Those aspects directly affect participants' ability to engage in group dynamics and potentially impact their self-esteem and well-being. However, improvements are observed on a daily basis, thanks to the combined efforts of team members and caregivers. The project has provided participants with means for self-expression and social interaction in a safe environment. Perceived difficulties thus far point toward the need for continued efforts in terms of social and digital inclusion for this population currently and beyond the pandemic setting.",alzheimer
34971248,With challenge comes opportunity: Dementia care innovations made in senior living during COVID that will outlast the pandemic.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Senior living communities are designed to foster social engagement and a sense of community between the residents. These settings offer a variety of care services and supports that are at their core relationship-centered and focused optimizing the health and wellness of the residents. COVID brought major disruptions to this communal environment. Residents accustomed to daily socialization and engagement were physically separated from each other and the broader community. The impact of this isolation was immediate and had a significant impact on residents' cognitive wellness. The pressing needs of COVID forced senior living to innovate in relation to the care of people living with dementia in these communities. We will discuss how innovations to process, infection control, technology, and design were used to keep residents safe from COVID and simultaneously maintain residents' physical and psychosocial well-being. Finally, we look to how these COVID-induced innovations can re-shape the future of dementia care in senior living.",alzheimer

34971241,Clinical experience with polygenic risk score in subjects with early cognitive concerns.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: There is mounting evidence that lifestyle interventions and behavioural changes play a significant role in maintaining cognition and function, as well as preventing dementia. Consequently, it is important that clinicians confronted with subjects with early cognitive concerns, have appropriate tools available to assist in diagnosis and to facilitate risks management appropriately. The application of polygenic risk score (PRS) tests has the potential to contribute towards management planning and to reduce the burden of testing in subjects with low overall risk. METHODS: This retrospective analysis considered the application of genoSCORE(TM) in a small cohort of patients seen over a six month period in a London Memory Clinic. The test was offered to selected patients in the clinic with MCI not clinically attributable to dementia, or cognitively normal individuals concerned about their risks of dementia. The impact upon clinical management and lifestyle modification was reviewed. genoSCORE, a polygenic risk score algorithm, was developed by Cytox to assess genetic risk for the future development of Late-Onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). RESULTS: Patients receiving the genoSCORE test included those with early MCI, subjective memory complaints and a small number concerned about their risk of dementia. In each case, a medical history was taken and individuals assessed using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, conducted either in clinic or remotely. genoSCORE polygenic risk score was easy to conduct and well received. The results stimulated individuals at risk of developing LOAD to make lifestyle adjustments and thereby potentially modifying their dementia risk. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the genoSCORE PRS test provided a valuable assessment of genetic risk of individuals most likely to decline cognitively decline towards AD and as such, contributed significantly to clinical management decisions. The ease and effectiveness of home sampling of saliva as source DNA for the PRS test was a major factor and well aligned with the continuing need for remote consultations in the light of COVID-19 concerns. Further larger-scale studies to determine the full clinical and associated economic impact of the genoSCORE PRS test are required.",alzheimer

34971221,Patient experience and satisfaction with remote memory assessment: Responding to clinical need in times of COVID-19 restrictions.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: The suspension of memory services during the COVID-19 pandemic delayed dementia diagnosis and access to early intervention. Some services responded to the challenge by developing a remote memory assessment pathway to comply with reduced social contact measures to protect vulnerable patients. The aim of the study was to establish whether remote model is considered a satisfactory experience within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and to understand the factors associated with patient and carer satisfaction of remote pathway. METHOD: 73 participants recruited from patients referred to memory clinic in West Sussex, who were assessed over a video or telephone. Participants completed an 11-item questionnaire capturing satisfaction across a range of elements, contextual items (the impact of the pandemic, loneliness, previous experience of using teleconference technology and diagnosis), as well as 3 dimensions from Patient Experience Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics are reported at a whole sample level, separated by patient and carer status. A hypothesis driven set of bivariate analyses (Spearman's rank) was used to understand the association between overall satisfaction and key independent factors across the whole sample. RESULTS: 73 participants were typically older adults (M=68.5, SD=13.3) and female (n=40, 54.8%). The patient was more likely to be older, feel lonely within the past week and to have used video call software when compared to the carer (p> 0.05). Participants were generally satisfied with the remote pathway with 95.8% (n=69) agreeing or strongly agreeing with the statement ""Overall, I was satisfied with the assessment"". Patients and carers did not significantly differ on any satisfaction response, apart from the ease of use of technology, in which carers were more likely to find the technology easy to use (U= 432.5; p=0.01). Worry about contracting COVID and communication experience was positively associated with overall satisfaction, whilst perceived communication barriers were significantly negatively associated with overall satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Remote memory assessment was a positive and satisfactory experience for most patient and carers. The remote pathway should be considered as an option available during and beyond the pandemic to improve access and patient choice of assessment modality.",alzheimer
34971212,Feasibility of multidisciplinary telehealth evaluations in atypical dementia.,Alzheimers Dement,"INTRODUCTION: While cognitive assessment by videoconference has become possible over the past decade, the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the critical need for expansion and examination of these methods, their appropriateness for various patient populations, and their benefits and limitations. Validity and reliability studies of tele-neuropsychological testing have been conducted in MCI or mild AD dementia patients (e.g., MMSE=25+); few studies have assessed the feasibility of neurologic examination by video, and none in atypical dementias, assuming that patients with some types (e.g., language, comportment) or greater severity of cognitive-behavioral impairment would be unable to participate. Here we report the feasibility of telehealth services for a multi-disciplinary dementia subspecialty clinic that include cognitive-behavioral and neurologic assessment with patients with atypical neurodegenerative syndromes. METHODS: 104 patient-carepartner (P-C) dyads met with providers in the MGH FTD Unit by videoconference (March-December, 2020) for routine clinical care. P-Cs completed validated questionnaires assessing cognition-mood/behavior/function on REDCap prior to video clinical interview and cognitive assessment, including the MoCA and Boston Cognitive Exam (BCE2.0), a newly revised brief cognitive assessment battery adapted for telehealth. P-Cs met with a neurologist for a basic neurologic examination (including eye-movement examination), review of assessment results, and discussion of care plan. P-Cs completed a satisfaction survey. RESULTS: The 104 P-Cs included a range of atypical neurodegenerative disorders (bvFTD, PCA, PPA, CBS, PSP, eoAD, Multidomain syndrome) mild-to-severe impairment (CDR range: 0-3). 76% completed the MoCA (25% had CDR=2). 36% also completed the BCEv2. Comparison of remote assessment data to previous in-person testing is ongoing. Of P-Cs who completed a satisfaction survey, all reported being ""very satisfied"" with the appointment, with 93% open to participating in a remote visit again. 87% found the telehealth visit comparable to an in-person visit. 66% preferred a future combination of remote and in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-disciplinary telehealth visits appear to be feasible with patients with atypical cognitive-behavioral syndromes of across the severity spectrum. P-Cs report a high degree of satisfaction with the telehealth visit and an openness to ongoing telehealth visits. Results have implications for increasing accessibility of multidisciplinary medical services for patients and families living with complex forms of dementia.",alzheimer
34971120,Home monitoring of daily living activities and prediction of agitation risk in a cohort of people living with dementia.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: People living with dementia (PLWD) have an increased susceptibility to developing adverse physical and psychological events. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies provides new ways to remotely monitor patients within the comfort of their homes, particularly important for the timely delivery of appropriate healthcare. Presented here is data collated as part of the on-going UK Dementia Research Institute's Care Research and Technology Centre cohort and Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) study. There are two main aims to this work: first, to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 quarantine on the performance of daily living activities of PLWD, on which there is currently little research; and second, to create a simple classification model capable of effectively predicting agitation risk in PLWD, allowing for the generation of alerts with actionable information by which to prevent such outcomes. METHOD: A within-subject, date-matched study was conducted on daily living activity data using the first COVID-19 quarantine as a natural experiment. Supervised machine learning approaches were then applied to combined physiological and environmental data to create two simple classification models: a single marker model trained using ambient temperature as a feature, and a multi-marker model using ambient temperature, body temperature, movement, and entropy as features. RESULT: There are 102 PLWD total included in the dataset, with all patients having an established diagnosis of dementia, but with ranging types and severity. The COVID-19 study was carried out on a sub-group of 21 patient households. In 2020, PLWD had a significant increase in daily household activity (p = 1.40e-08), one-way repeated measures ANOVA). Moreover, there was a significant interaction between the pandemic quarantine and patient gender on night-time bed-occupancy duration (p = 3.00e-02, two-way mixed-effect ANOVA). On evaluating the models using 10-fold cross validation, both the single and multi-marker model were shown to balance precision and recall well, having F1-scores of 0.80 and 0.66, respectively. CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring technologies provide a continuous and reliable way of monitoring patient day-to-day wellbeing. The application of statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms to combined physiological and environmental data has huge potential to positively impact the delivery of healthcare for PLWD.",alzheimer
34971113,Remote cognitive rehabilitation in patients post-cerebrovascular accident: an experience report.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Aiming to contribute to the reduction of cognitive impairment, as well as to improve the quality of life of patients affected by stroke, it was proposed to carry out a cognitive rehabilitation focused on attentional aspects (sustained, alternate, selective and divided attention). Due to the new Coronavirus pandemic and the need for social isolation, the rehabilitation was adapted to the remote model. METHODS: The rehabilitation was designed and carried out with six patients, coming from a public neurology outpatient service, who had suffered a stroke within a period of up to one year before the start of rehabilitation. Fifteen sessions of cognitive rehabilitation were carried out, lasting approximately 50 minutes, once a week, for four months. In all functions, the four types of attention were worked on. In addition, there were also unassisted activities performed by the patients after each session. RESULTS: The protocol was carried out by Psychology and Medicine students, who elaborated and adapted all activities to be performed by video call. The adaptations were made based on the knowledge and effectiveness of face-to-face rehabilitation for this population. Patients and family members collaborated in the activities, but the emergency adaptation to the remote model also had limitations, such as the withdrawal of some patients due to difficulty access or unstable internet connection. However, there were also positive results, such as the possibility of participation by people from other cities and people with mobility difficulties. This experience allowed students to develop skills in interacting with patients, as well as strategies to deal with the challenges of remote care. Thus, it was not necessary to interrupt the students education, moreover, the skills developed are important for the e-health context, which is an increasingly present demand in today's world. CONCLUSION: Remote cognitive rehabilitation is a possibility for patients who have suffered cognitive impairment due to stroke. Despite the difficulties arising from the pandemic, it was an important experience, with significant value for academic training, which stimulated the skills needed to care for patients, in addition to creativity and adaptation in the face of adversity.",alzheimer
34971112,"ReMember-Me system: Developing a new, remote digital tool for detecting and preventing cognitive decline.",Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: The COVID19 pandemic and social distancing measures imposed have intensified the need for tools allowing the remote and early assessment of cognitive decline, in order to prevent undiagnosed neurocognitive disorder cases among older adults. The goal of the ReMember-Me project (Image 1), funded by the EC and AAL Programme, is to create a remote, digital system for detecting, preventing and addressing cognitive decline early on. The first system prototype released includes the ReMember-Me Cognitive Assessment Scale (RMCAS), a new digital instrument to detect cognitive difficulties, as well as, measures of physical, psychoemotional and motor status, sleep quality and serious games. The RMCAS includes 19 tasks assessing orientation, verbal, visual and prospective memory, calculation, attention, executive function, language and abstract thinking. METHOD: The system is being, currently, pilot-tested with 14 healthy and cognitively fit older adults (M=74.50, SD=4.14, 77.8% females) in a pre-post intervention study. Participants completed a baseline assessment with the ReMember-Me system and other standardized tools and will be tested again after two months to explore any intervention effects. RESULT: The preliminary results showed that RMCAS has good fidelity and homogeneity (Table 1), individual items can yield results comparable to the Mini Mental State Examination (Table 2) while the digital administration of RMCAS did not seem to have any effect on performance compared to the traditional, hard copy administration (F=2.319, p>.05) CONCLUSION: The preliminary results of the study indicate that the RMCAS may be a promising new digital instrument for the remote assessment of cognitive decline. Further testing is planned with 350 people in total, including participants with neurocognitive disorder, in total, to draw more concrete conclusions regarding its validity and reliability.",alzheimer
34971109,Feasibility and evaluation of the Dementia Engagement Modelling Program (DEMP): a novel model of aged care during COVID-19.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on the quality of life of aged care residents living with dementia (RLWD). Lockdown measures necessary to protect RLWD and caring staff from COVID-19 have resulted in increased social isolation, loneliness, and behaviors and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). In response, the Australian Government funded a pilot program, the Dementia Engagement Modelling Program (DEMP) as part of the Aged Care COVID-19 Grief and Trauma support package for RLWD, their families and aged care staff. Operated by the Dementia Centre of HammondCare, the DEMP provides first-line multimodal external support for RLWD at a greater risk of developing BPSD due to COVID-19 restrictions. This study aims to describe the DEMP and evaluate its feasibility and outcomes for Australian RLWD. METHODS: A team of 10 trained DEMP consultants was involved in delivering a consultancy service that modelled best practice and person-centred activities of engagement to support staff in providing residents with meaningful purpose, comfort, and reassurance. Consultants also provided coaching and development opportunities for staff to enhance their knowledge regarding communication and engagement. Outcome measures included the regular administration of the Engagement in Preferred ActivitieS Scale (EPASS; >/=4-9 moderate-to-high engagement). A phone evaluation survey for supported residential aged care homes (RACHs) was conducted to determine the feasibility of DEMP. RESULTS: A total of 60 residents (86.0 +/- 7.8 y; 68% female) across 10 RACHs from three Australian states (VIC, NSW, QLD) was supported by DEMP between May and July 2021. More than half of the residents had Alzheimer's disease (n = 24, 40%) and vascular dementia (n = 7, 12%). Completed EPASS assessments (n = 389) demonstrated that the vast majority (64%-72%) of residents scored moderate-to-high engagement. All supported RACHs highly recommended the DEMP to other colleagues and rated the program highly for implementation feasibility including the recommended engagement activities/brokered items. CONCLUSIONS: The DEMP is a novel, feasible and effective dementia-specific engagement modelling program for Australian RLWD in the era of COVID-19 pandemic.",alzheimer
34971091,The impact of presentation modality on cognitive test performance for adults with hearing loss.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating hearing loss in middle-aged and older adults is independently associated with an increased risk of developing cognitive-decline and dementia. Verbal memory is one of the most common functions to decline early in Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia Whilst the exact mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear, poorer test performance may reflect an overarching sensory deficit, as, for instance, most verbal memory tests are predominantly delivered auditorily. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether different modes of presentation (i.e., visual, or auditory) influence verbal memory screening test performance in those who failed a hearing screener. METHOD: The study was conducted via online video-conferencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N= 63) completed a validated hearing screener, which was a digit-in-noise test delivered via the hearWHO smartphone application. Three cognitive tests were also administered: (1) the Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-M), presented auditorily; (2) the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), presented visually; and (3) a verbal fluency task as a control. All tests have been used as dementia screening tests. RESULT: Separate ANCOVAs revealed that, when controlling for age, gender, and education level, adults who failed the hearing screener performed more poorly on the TICS-M compared to individuals who passed (p<.001). No differences between hearing groups were found for the other cognitive tests administered (p>/= .132). CONCLUSION: This study provides support for the notion that the presentation mode of cognitive tests may account for some of the deficits observed in older adults with hearing loss. As such, researchers and clinicians should be mindful of the sensory deficits experienced by individuals when interpreting cognitive test performance, to avoid the overestimation of cognitive deficits and dementia in adults with hearing loss.",alzheimer
34971088,Effect of COVID-19 on BPSD severity and caregiver distress: Trend data from national dementia-specific behavior support programs in Australia.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Globally, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused a significant disruption to the physical and mental well-being of all individuals, including those living with dementia. Social restrictions and lockdown measures due to COVID-19 have worsened the feelings of loneliness and behaviours and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). National BPSD support programs in Australia are offered by Dementia Support Australia (DSA) through the Dementia Behavior Management Advisory Service (DBMAS) and the Severe Behavior Response Teams (SBRT). This study aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on BPSD severity and related caregiver distress among referrals to DSA programs. METHODS: A retrospective comparative analysis was conducted on the intake data of referrals to DSA between two periods: Pre-COVID-19 Period (January 2018-Decmeber 2019) and COVID-19 Period (January 2020-July 2021). Referrals were compared on demographic characteristics (e.g., age), and BPSD severity (i.e., neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation) and caregiver distress as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). NPI scores were compared on a month-to-month basis between the specified periods. RESULTS: Across the two periods, there were a total of 23,180 referrals eligible for the analysis. While no differences were noted in age, sex, or dementia subtype, there were elevated levels of NPI severity and caregiver distress scores during COVID-19 Period compared to the Pre-COVID-19 Period. The month-to-month trends of these differences (Figure 1, Figure 2) reflect the timing of outbreaks across Australia. Specifically, there were no significant differences at the start of 2020 prior to the declaration of the pandemic, with an initial rise in NPI severity and distress through April after initial measures were implemented nationally in March 2020. These levels of severity and distress continued to rise through the remainder of 2020, alongside outbreaks in specific regions within Australia, such as Victoria (June-October), and New South Wales (December/January). NPI severity and caregiver distress then began to return to Pre-COVID levels from February-May before elevating again with the outbreak of the Delta variant in Australia. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has a significant impact on the severity levels of BPSD and related caregiver distress.",alzheimer
34971087,Latin American Older people and neuropsychiatric symptoms: a mini-systematic review of effects of COVID-19 Pandemic.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Ending December 2019, the world had to face to COVID-19. Latin America and the Caribbean suffered the effects where the contiguous and the number of deaths has been significant. Studies indicate that older adults with some degree of cognitive impairment are at greater risk of worsening their cognitive status and mental health, for this reason it's exposed that social isolation and loneliness has harmful effects on the health of this population. This mini-review inquires on the effects of COVID-19 due to social isolation on neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Latin American older adults with and without dementia. METHOD: A search was carried out in PubMed, SCOPUS, and ScienceDirect identifying all articles published up to July 31, 2021 using the keywords ""social isolation"", ""lockdown"", ""quarantine"", ""COVID-19"",, ""neuropsychiatric symptoms "", ""neurobehavioral"", ""dementia"","" mild cognitive impairment "","" Older People "", ""aging"", ""elderly"". Two independent reviewers screened and selected appropriate articles and a third researcher helped resolve disagreements. The selected articles met the following criteria: written in English, Spanish or Portuguese, original article; focused on elderly subjects, articles that provided information on the NPS effects in Latin American populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The review was based on the PRISMA Statement and used the SIGN criteria. RESULT: From 61 articles recovered from electronic databases (PubMed, Science Direct and Scopus) 10 of them were chosen for this review. The majority of the articles reported in a general way a negative impact on the mental health of the population in Latin America. They referred to a significant increase in the anxiety and depression symptoms. The majority of the articles were studies developed in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 has shown a negative impact on the mental health of older adults. Latin America is a region with important socio-sanitary problems which increase the impact of the pandemic in SNP, especially in older adults. It's necessary to increase the studies in Latin America that glimpse the real situation in the region.",alzheimer
34971068,"Developing a digital assistive tool for dementia patients and their caregivers: A qualitative study on needs, potential functions, practical requirements, user acceptance, and ethical considerations.",Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Digital smartphone assistants for the care and support of people with dementia (PwD) have great potential due to the wide availability of smartphones and a growing number of users aged above 65. Research has mainly focused on the development of applications for only one user group (patients, caregivers, or relatives respectively), and with only one or a few functions included (Yousaf et al., 2020). A more integrative, multi-user, and multifunctional application would be beneficial because it could be adapted to the users' needs more flexibly. This qualitative interview study was the first step in a co-creative process with a user-centered approach aimed at developing a multifunctional digital assistant. METHOD: Qualitative content analysis (Mayring, 2010) combining deductive and inductive techniques was applied to identify burdens, needs, functions, ethical considerations, and acceptance aspects. 14 semi-structured interviews were conducted with three participant groups (relatives of PwD; caregivers and nursing staff; psychologists). Interviews were conducted via video conferences due to Covid-19 restrictions. After the completion of all interviews, participants received several questionnaires on acceptance aspects (Technology Usage Inventory [TUI], acceptance rating of specific functions), and technological affinity (TA-EG questionnaire) via letter. Interviews were transcribed verbatim with the software MAXQDA. Coding was done by two independent researchers. A coding frame was generated using the interview guide as a theoretical basis and the collected data for building inductive categories. The coding frame was pilot-tested before the final analysis and intercoder reliability was sufficient (k=.81). RESULT: Preliminary results showed that dealing with symptoms of dementia in everyday life was burdening. Emotional needs in patients and needs for additional care resources in relatives and caregivers were the most important unanswered needs. 53 functions were suggested in the areas: digital care, support, training, monitoring, navigation, leisure activities, and social contacts. Participants had ethical requirements (i.e. data protection, privacy, and autonomy) that if met, would enhance acceptance. Results on questionnaires showed positive attitudes towards, curiosity about, and no insecurity with regards to technology. The overall acceptability of suggested functions was high. CONCLUSION: Participants showed a large interest in the digital assistant. The importance of data protection was underlined.",alzheimer
34971061,LifeBio memory's technology advancements for capturing life stories and seeing the whole person.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Capturing the complexity of an individual's uniqueness and life experiences is difficult. New technology approaches are needed to simplify the process of knowing the person's story to improve care and communication. METHOD: LifeBio is currently developing a cross-platform application (tablet, phone, web-based), called LifeBio Memory(TM) for people living with Alzheimer's Disease or mild cognitive impairment. Utilizing groundbreaking technologies (including artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and speech to text conversions), LifeBio Memory is a novel machine-learning-based application that converts speech to text and generates life stories. LifeBio Memory will serve as an interactive tool to cultivate communication between people living with dementia, their family, and professional care partners. The LifeBio Memory application uses a new voice-based application to prompt and store individuals' stories, photos, and videos-resulting in a personalized, therapeutic reminiscence experience. Auto-summarization technology will make a ""quick read"" version of the story possible; knowing the person improves quality. RESULT: Current results show a speech to text conversion accuracy of approximately 99% with standard audio captures, and conversion rate accuracy above 90% in multiple voice files, which are the more difficult scenarios. Human parity is considered to be above 94%. LifeBio Memory has the initial automation of the extraction of keywords and phrases that will be utilized to summarize the life story. LifeBio and its research partner, Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging, have recently completed focus groups and people living with Alzheimer's Disease were the first to see, use, and evaluate the new application. Professionals in memory care and family members of people living with dementia were also included in focus groups. CONCLUSION: Initial focus groups have evaluated the new LifeBio Memory software. These first focus groups gave valuable feedback on preferences, likes and dislikes, and ease-of-use for the application. Including people living with dementia in focus groups (online focus groups during COVID) for technology products like LifeBio Memory has been a valuable experience, and more details on lessons learned and next steps will be shared. NOTE: LifeBio Memory is supported by an SBIR grant from the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health under Federal Award Identification Number R44AG069566.",alzheimer
34971057,Patient attitudes towards remote memory clinic assessment.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Due to demand on UK memory clinic services, most patients have limited consultant interaction before diagnosis/discharge. Technology offers an opportunity for remote assessment, from telephone/video-based consultations to fully digitised cognitive assessments with potential to track disease progression. Whilst many acute services utilise remote assessment, there are perceived barriers in memory clinic populations. However, COVID-19 and related national restrictions may have altered patients' attitudes towards and experience with remote assessment tools. We aimed to investigate attitudes including confidence and perceived challenges towards remote assessment as well as access and experience with technology amongst Oxfordshire memory clinic patients. METHOD: Between June and September 2020, all patients awaiting initial memory clinic assessment were asked to participate in a standardised semi-quantitative survey as part of an Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust service evaluation. Designed with service-user input, questions aimed to capture availability, experience and confidence using technology and patients' comfort with assessment, diagnosis and future care discussions being conducted remotely, as well as any concerns or comments. RESULT: Amongst 73 respondents (average age=79.1 years), access to technology was high; 82% reported telephone access and 58% to a laptop, tablet, smartphone or combination of the three. 17% reported previous use of web-based video conferencing tools, and although confidence using these tools was 7%, this increased with written instruction or relative assistance. Similarly, whilst under half of the respondents felt comfortable with assessments, diagnosis or future care discussions occurring remotely, this increased to approximately two thirds with relative presence (67%, 69% and 66%, respectively). Qualitative analysis of patient's comments regarding remote assessment also revealed concerns over wait times/urgent need for assessment. However, 62% preferred to wait for an in-person visit, rather than an immediate remote appointment. CONCLUSION: This survey demonstrates availability of technology in this population but a disparity in willingness to engage in remote assessment. Consequently, there is a need to diverge from one-size-fits-all models to a tiered approach that helps facilitate individual choice based on the availability/confidence with technology and level of relative support. The Oxford Brain Health Centre, an integrated clinical-research service, provides an opportunity to research this tiered approach in clinical practice.",alzheimer
34971052,Leveraging virtual reality to train certified nursing assistants as essential dementia-care personnel in the age of COVID-19.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has placed an extraordinary and disproportionate level of responsibility and risk on certified nursing assistants (CNAs) caring for persons with dementia (PWD) relative to their training, resources, and compensation levels. Nearly one-quarter of COVID-19 deaths in the United States have been nursing home residents and staff. Despite providing the majority of direct care, CNAs are amongst the most under-resourced and under-trained frontline workers. Given their essentiality, it is critical to support CNAs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this work is to provide CNAs with a space to strengthen their knowledge and confidence in caring for PWD. This pilot study applies a virtual reality (VR) curriculum to train CNAs regarding the lived experiences of PWD and their loved ones. The VR vignette portrays a Latinx woman, Beatriz, through progressive stages of Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: Chicago Methodist Senior Services (CMSS) CNAs were recruited (N=7; 86% female, 86% Black) for a seven-week online training program consisting of 1.5 hours per week. Each class included a didactic lecture and an Embodied Labs VR module depicting a first-person experience of dementia through a distributive model approach. The program concluded with two recorded focus groups. Participants completed the UCLA Geriatric Attitudes Scale, a dementia knowledge assessment, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index surveys, and a COVID-19 Impact questionnaire. Current analyses include qualitative content analysis for focus group data and descriptive, quantitative statistics for pre-and post-VR intervention surveys. RESULT: Preliminary results demonstrate that CNAs endorsed a positive change in attitudes toward older adults (p=0.069), a deepened understanding of dementia, and increased confidence in caregiving skills. Focus groups allowed CNAs to discuss changes in resident behavior and support one another through a virtual platform during a global pandemic. CONCLUSION: Combining traditional didactic lectures with VR-based curricula provided CNAs with foundational knowledge and first-hand experience of dementia pathology. Participants reported greater levels of insight and empathy for PWD. Future aims include expansion of training content to include end-of-life conversations, LGBTQIA aging, and Lewy body dementia.",alzheimer
34971048,Technology-driven dyadic interaction in caregiving.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Due to the ongoing pandemic and the resulting community lockdowns, people with dementia and their family might be at risk of social deprivation and increased relationship strains. Technological means have the potential to engage participants in meaningful positive interactions. The tablet-based activation system I-CARE offers social activities specifically designed for people with dementia and their caregivers, by offering user-specific contents adapted to their needs and sensitivities. Little is known about the impact of Covid-19 on social health for this population. The ongoing study, presented as a part of the Marie-Curie Innovative-Training-Network action, H2020-MSCA-ITN, grant agreement 813196, assesses how COVID-19 has impacted community-dwelling dementia caregiving dyads. Contextual factors of technology use and motivations for inviting technology into social interactions is explored. METHOD: As a part an ongoing pre-post mixed-methods feasibility study, baseline assessments through semi-structured interviews were conducted and subjected to inductive thematic statement analysis by two independent researchers. RESULT: Participants differed in how COVID-19 restrictions impacted their lives and how they coped with dementia, revealing different motivations for inviting technology into their lives. Dyads who were socially active pre-COVID-19, and who managed use technology to maintain social participation during COVID-19, reported to have been less negatively impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Four subthemes within ""Social technology during COVID-19"" were identified. CONCLUSION: During and beyond this pandemic, social technology is a valuable tool to promote social participation in this population. Successful uptake of technology is dependent on customizing to individuals' needs and conditions.",alzheimer
34971042,Smartphone ownership and usage in Chinese- and English-speaking older adults.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Data collection by smartphone is becoming more widespread in healthcare research. Previous studies reported racial/ethnical differences in the use of digital health technology. However, cross-language group comparison (Chinese- and English-speaking older adults) were not performed in these studies. This project will expand to smartphone technology use in diverse older populations with a focus on Chinese American older adults who are monolingual Chinese-speakers. METHOD: The Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) evaluates diverse older populations using National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set (NACC UDS). The UDS has different language versions, including English and Chinese. The evaluation includes a medical examination, cognitive assessments, and a research blood draw. Smartphone ownership and usage were captured using a local questionnaire developed by our ADRC. The questionnaire, available in English and Chinese, was administered by our ADRC coordinators during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to examine differences in technology ownership and usages between the two language groups, while controlling for age, gender, education, and cognitive status (measured by Clinical Dementia Rating). RESULT: 33 Chinese- and 117 English-speaking older adults who received a diagnosis of normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment at consensus were included in the data analysis. Results reveal a high prevalence of smartphone ownership in our Chinese- (100%) and English-speaking older participants (86.3%). Participants in both language groups use mobile technology for a wide range of purposes, such as getting news and other information (Chinese=90.9%; English=87.2%), sending/receiving text (Chinese=97.0%; English=96.6%), watching videos/TV shows (Chinese=78.8%; English=69.2%), and taking classes (Chinese=57.5%; English=57.3%). However, Chinese-speaking older adults were less likely than English-speaking older adults to use mobile technology to post their own reviews or comments online (Chinese=9.1%; English=39.3%, p=0.001), download or purchase an app (Chinese=21.2%; English=70.9%, p<0.001), track health/ fitness via apps/website (Chinese=12.1%; English=47.9%, p<0.001) and manage/receive medical care (Chinese=15.2%; English=67.5%, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight potential barriers to smartphone usage in Chinese American older adults with limited English proficiency. The results have implications for how smartphone technology can be used in clinical practice and aging research.",alzheimer
34971039,Type and frequency of social contacts associated with low mood before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults: I-CONECT project.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Social isolation is a risk factor for dementia, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. It is possible that lack of social contacts negatively affects emotional well-being, which leads to cognitive decline. To shed light on this potential mediation mechanism, we examined changes in type and frequency of social contacts and their effects on mood using data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among socially isolated older adults aged 75 and older. METHOD: The data come from an ongoing randomized controlled trial, the Internet-Based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial (I-CONECT, ClinicalTirals.gov: NCT02871921). One hundred forty-six participants (age=81.0+/-4.5, 71.9% women) who were in the trial both before and during the pandemic and whose data were available as of November of 2020 were included in the current analysis. Weekly health questionnaires administered on all participants regardless of treatment assignments were collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Low mood (""Blueness"") was self-reported as feeling downhearted or blue for three or more days in the past week (YES/NO). Social contacts were self-reported by amount of time they had interacted, with whom (family; friends; others), and via which modalities (in-person; phone/video call; text/email). RESULT: A total of 4,774 weeks of survey data were analyzed (3,047 before COVID 19). The weekly average time spent in-person, on phone/video call, and via text/email were 282, 113, and 44 minutes, respectively. During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants on average spent 82 minutes less in total social contact per week (in-person: reduced 123 minutes, video/call: increased 28 minutes, text/email: increased 13 minutes per week). Generalized estimating equation model revealed that in-person family contact was associated with less blueness regardless of the pandemic (OR=0.91, p=0.04). There was a COVID*text/email time with friends interaction (OR=0.68, p=0.03), suggesting that during the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase of 1 hour of texting/emailing with friends per week was associated with 32% decrease in experiencing blueness three or more days per week. CONCLUSION: In-person family time is beneficial for mental health. While in-person contacts become less frequent during the COVID-19 pandemic, increased text/email time with friends becomes an alternative to maintain mental health for socially isolated older adults.",alzheimer
34971035,Health care professionals and use of digital technologies in patients with dementia and related disorders.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Digital technologies (digiTech) enhance benefits in healthcare and are present in elderly people lives. Healthcare professionals (HCP) who deal with dementia and related disorders face enormous challenges in delivering healthcare using digital devices, and Covid-19 pandemic showed these pitfalls should be addressed. Technology solutions in elder people are being developed, not every HCP is heard, and we lack information about what these professionals think about this. METHODS: Using structured questionnaires and asynchronous electrotonic data capture, we asked experienced (84.3% postgraduate degrees) HCP with different backgrounds (8 practice areas) about what they think of technology use among their patients and carers. The average person in our sample (N = 51) was a highly skilled (22.2 study-years) female (70.6%) medical doctor (62.8%) aged 39.1 years old (27 to 77 years), highly exposed to digiTech (68.6% mobile devices usage >/=4 hours/day). Neurologists (37.3%), neuropsychologists (15.7%), psychiatrists (13.7%), geriatricians (11.8%) were the most represented groups. This observational cross-sectional study is part of a Brazilian pilot study to explore technology usage in higher risk dementia adults (DigiTAU Project). RESULTS: Although HCP consider asking patients and carers about technology use to be theoretically important (90.2%) and useful in practice (94.2%), they often do not do it (45.1%). There is incongruity when they feel safe to offer interventions by digital means (58.8%) but commonly agree, on average, that HCP are not prepared to use digiTech (51.0%). Despite having positive views towards benefits in adopting digiTech for patients (98.1%), they think they bring more benefits to families and caregivers than to patients themselves (56.9%). HCP consider digiTech will change their practice in the short term within 1 year (58.8%) and within 5 years (88.3%). None of the 8 options suggested as the most ""promising"" technology in 10 years reaches more than 25% of the choices. CONCLUSIONS: HCP have conflicting views about the usage of technologies by their patients and caregivers but expect some positive changes in their work practice. It suggests new digiTech must be submitted to scrutiny so that its applicability overcomes the challenges. Further studies and analysis are needed to understand better this data.",alzheimer
34971033,Seas the day: Co-designing immersive virtual reality exergames with exercise professionals and people living with dementia.,Alzheimers Dement,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is associated with physical and cognitive benefits among people living with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (PLWD/MCI) and is a meaningful activity that can improve their confidence in everyday life. Exercising in virtual reality environments (VR Exergame) is becoming an increasingly feasible and enjoyable way to promote PA and well-being in PLWD/MCI. Although co-design can significantly improve the design of technology, it is rarely done with PLWD/MCI. This study uses participatory design methods and collaborative approaches to involve key stakeholders to develop and test a VR Exergame ""Seas the Day"", a novel solution targeting PLWD/MCI well-being. METHODS: A multi-stage, user-centered co-design approach was used to custom-build VR Exergames tailored to the unique needs and abilities of PLWD/MCI based on a first generation of the prototype that was previously developed and tested with PLWD/MCI. This paper describes the next iteration of the prototype. Processes included concept ideation and brainstorming activities, iterative prototyping, and playtesting/input/feedback sessions with key stakeholders (PLWD/MCI, exercise professionals, engineers, VR game designers, content developers). RESULTS: The multidisciplinary and collaborative design process occurred over 15 months (overlapping with COVID-19 pandemic) with 7 PLWD/MCI (6 females; M=81.3 years) and 9 exercise professionals (7 females; M=38.1 years) to date. The game was designed to target movements identified by exercise professionals and researchers (aerobic exercises, range of motion, seated-balance, quick response to stimuli) and is structured in three exercise stages (warm-up, conditioning, cool-down). To ensure safety of participants while using VR headsets, only seated upper-limb exercises were targeted. Stakeholder feedback regarding game mechanics, aesthetics, and visual/auditory cues were gathered during brainstorming and playtesting sessions and implemented into specific game-related scenarios (tai-chi, rowing, fishing). CONCLUSION: We presented the process, outcomes, and challenges of adopting a participatory/collaborative approach with multiple stakeholder groups to co-design VR Exergames tailored to PLWD/MCI. Next steps will include a mixed-method evaluation of the VR Exergames among community-dwelling older adults and PLWD/MCI in retirement communities and long-term care to evaluate: i) feasibility and acceptability of use, ii) game user experience, iii) barriers/facilitators to uptake of VR Exergames; and iv) inform/validate VR Exergames gameplay metrics reflective of cognitive and motor performance.",alzheimer
34967216,Graphene-based Nanomaterials in Fighting the Most Challenging Viruses and Immunogenic Disorders.,ACS Biomater Sci Eng,"Viral diseases have long been among the biggest challenges for healthcare systems around the world. The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an example of how complicated the situation can get if we are not prepared to combat a viral outbreak in time, which brings up the need for quick and affordable biosensing platforms and vast knowledge of potential antiviral effects and drug/gene delivery opportunities. The same challenges have also existed for nonviral immunogenic disorders. Nanomedicine is considered a novel candidate for effectively overcoming these worldwide challenges. Among the versatile nanomaterials commonly used in biomedical applications, graphene has recently earned much attention thanks to its special and inspiring physicochemical properties, such as its large surface area, efficient thermal/electrical properties, carbon-based chemical purity with controllable biocompatibility, easy functionalization, capability of single-molecule detection, anticancer characteristics, 3D template feature in tissue engineering, and, in particular, antibacterial/antiviral activities. In this Review, the most important and challenging viruses of our era, such as human immunodeficiency virus, Ebola, SARS-CoV-2, norovirus, and hepatitis virus, and immunogenic disorders, such as asthma, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, in which graphene-based nanomaterials can effectively take part in the prevention, detection, treatment, medication, and health effect issues, have been covered and discussed.",alzheimer
34966022,Long-term Neuropsychiatric Complications and 18F-FDG-PET Hypometabolism in the Brain From Prolonged Infection of COVID-19.,Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord,"It is becoming increasingly clear that the worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will have long-term negative consequences. Some patients report functional complaints long after recovery from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), which include fatigue, breathlessness, heart palpitations, loss or alteration of taste and smell, and problems with attention, memory, and cognition. However, the long-term complications for those patients who had severe symptoms and prolonged hypoxia during their course of their hospital stay is still unknown. We report 2 patients with confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 who experienced prolonged infection and developed rapid progressive dementia following COVID-19 pneumonia after a follow-up period of 5 to 10 months. As these cases may become more prevalent over time, we should learn to recognize the early signs of long-term COVID-19 complications in those who are especially vulnerable to neurocognitive decline.",alzheimer
34951387,Biomedical Perspectives of Acute and Chronic Neurological and Neuropsychiatric Sequelae of COVID-19.,Curr Neuropharmacol,"The incidence of infections from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has dramatically escalated following the initial outbreak in China in late 2019, resulting in a global pandemic with millions of deaths. Although the majority of infected patients survive, and the rapid advent and deployment of vaccines have afforded increased immunity against SARS-CoV-2, long term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have become increasingly recognized. These include, but are not limited to, chronic pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disorders, and proinflammatory-associated neurological dysfunction that may lead to psychological and neurocognitive impairment. A major component of cognitive dysfunction is operationally categorized as ""brain fog"" which comprises difficulty with concentration, forgetfulness, confusion, depression, and fatigue. Multiple parameters associated with long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been detailed in clinical studies. Empirically elucidated mechanisms associated with the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 are by nature complex, but broad based working models have focused on mitochondrial dysregulation leading to systemic reductions of metabolic activity and cellular bioenergetics within CNS structures. Multiple factors underlying the expression of brain fog may facilitate future pathogenic insults leading to repetitive cycles of viral and bacterial propagation. Interestingly, diverse neurocognitive sequelae associated with COVID-19 are not dissimilar from those observed in other historical pandemics, thereby providing a broad and integrative perspective on potential common mechanisms of CNS dysfunction subsequent to viral infection. Poor mental health status may be reciprocally linked to compromised immune processes and enhanced susceptibility to infection by diverse pathogens. By extrapolation, we contend that COVID-19 may potentiate the severity of neurological/neurocognitive deficits in patients afflicted by well-studied neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Accordingly, the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sustained neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 are pivotal health care directives and provide a compelling rationale for careful monitoring of infected patients, as early mitigation efforts may reduce short- and long-term complications.",alzheimer
34948400,"SARS-CoV-2 Exacerbates Beta-Amyloid Neurotoxicity, Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in Alzheimer's Disease Patients.",Int J Mol Sci,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) triggered the pandemic Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), causing millions of deaths. The elderly and those already living with comorbidity are likely to die after SARS-CoV-2 infection. People suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) have a higher risk of becoming infected, because they cannot easily follow health roles. Additionally, those suffering from dementia have a 40% higher risk of dying from COVID-19. Herein, we collected from Gene Expression Omnibus repository the brain samples of AD patients who died of COVID-19 (AD+COVID-19), AD without COVID-19 (AD), COVID-19 without AD (COVID-19) and control individuals. We inspected the transcriptomic and interactomic profiles by comparing the COVID-19 cohort against the control cohort and the AD cohort against the AD+COVID-19 cohort. SARS-CoV-2 in patients without AD mainly activated processes related to immune response and cell cycle. Conversely, 21 key nodes in the interactome are deregulated in AD. Interestingly, some of them are linked to beta-amyloid production and clearance. Thus, we inspected their role, along with their interactors, using the gene ontologies of the biological process that reveals their contribution in brain organization, immune response, oxidative stress and viral replication. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 worsens the AD condition by increasing neurotoxicity, due to higher levels of beta-amyloid, inflammation and oxidative stress.",alzheimer
34945251,How COVID-19 Has Affected Caregivers' Burden of Patients with Dementia: An Exploratory Study Focusing on Coping Strategies and Quality of Life during the Lockdown.,J Clin Med,"COVID-19 has caused a public and international health emergency, leading to isolation and social distancing. These restrictions have had a significant impact on the caregivers of people with dementia, increasing the burden of patient management. The purpose of this study was to investigate the stress perceived by caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) during the pandemic. We used a cross-sectional survey design to evaluate the caregivers' psychological responses and coping strategies. Eighty-four caregivers of patients with a diagnosis of AD were involved in this study by completing an online questionnaire. They presented a high perception of stress (the Perceived Stress Scale mean +/- DS: 33.5 +/- 4.5), and their high burden in caring was mainly related to physical difficulties (Caregiver Burden Inventory-Physical Burden mean +/- DS: 15.0 +/- 2.1) and perception of loss of time (Caregiver Burden Inventory-Time-dependence Burden mean +/- DS: 16.5 +/- 1.4). Moreover, caregivers perceived their quality of life as very low (Short Form-12 Health Survey Physical mean +/- DS: 13.5 +/- 2.7; Short Form-12 Health Survey Mental Health mean +/- DS: 16.4 +/- 4.2). Finally, we found that participants mostly used dysfunctional coping strategies, such as avoidance strategies (Coping Orientation to Problem Experiences-Avoidance Strategies mean +/- DS: 39.5 +/- 7.1), but these strategies did not affect the stress level of caregivers. Given that caregivers present a high burden and stress, innovative tools could be a valuable solution to investigate and support their emotional and behavioral status during difficult periods, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",alzheimer
34942927,Effect of Sensory Deprivation of Nasal Respiratory on Behavior of C57BL/6J Mice.,Brain Sci,"Nasal breathing is a dynamic cortical organizer involved in various behaviors and states, such as locomotion, exploration, memory, emotion, introspection. However, the effect of sensory deprivation of nasal respiratory breath (NRD) on behavior remain poorly understood. Herein, general locomotor activity, emotion, learning and memory, social interaction, and mechanical pain were evaluated using a zinc sulfate nasal irrigation induced nasal respiratory sensory deprivation animal model (ZnSO4-induced mouse model). In the open field test, the elevated O-maze test, and forced swim test, NRD mice exhibited depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. In memory-associated tests, NRD mice showed cognitive impairments in the hippocampal-dependent memory (Y maze, object recognition task, and contextual fear conditioning (CFC)) and amygdala-dependent memory (the tone-cued fear conditioning test (TFC)). Surprisingly, NRD mice did not display deficits in the acquisition of conditional fear in both CFC and TFC tests. Still, they showed significant memory retrieval impairment in TFC and enhanced memory retrieval in CFC. At the same time, in the social novelty test using a three-chamber setting, NRD mice showed impaired social and social novelty behavior. Lastly, in the von Frey filaments test, we found that the pain sensitivity of NRD mice was reduced. In conclusion, this NRD mouse model showed a variety of behavioral phenotypic changes, which could offer an important insight into the behavioral impacts of patients with anosmia or those with an impaired olfactory bulb (OB) (e.g., in COVID-19, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc.).",alzheimer
34942135,"Safety, efficacy, and tolerability of memantine for cognitive and adaptive outcome measures in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial.",Lancet Neurol,"BACKGROUND: Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder with considerable neurodevelopmental impact and neurodegenerative morbidity. In a pilot trial in young adults with Down syndrome, memantine (a drug approved for Alzheimer's disease) showed a significant effect on a secondary measure of episodic memory. We aimed to test whether memantine would improve episodic memory in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial with a parallel design, stratified by age and sex. Participants (aged 15-32 years) with either trisomy 21 or complete unbalanced translocation of chromosome 21 and in general good health were recruited from the community at one site in Brazil and another in the USA. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either memantine (20 mg/day orally) or placebo for 16 weeks. Computer-generated randomisation tables for both sites (allocating a placebo or drug label to each member of a unique pair of participants) were centrally produced by an independent statistician and were shared only with investigational pharmacists at participating sites until unblinding of the study. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignments. Neuropsychological assessments were done at baseline (T1) and week 16 (T2). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 16 in the California Verbal Learning Test-second edition short-form (CVLT-II-sf) total free recall score, assessed in the per-protocol population (ie, participants who completed 16 weeks of treatment and had neuropsychological assessments at T1 and T2). Linear mixed effect models were fit to data from the per-protocol population. Safety and tolerability were monitored and analysed in all participants who started treatment. Steady-state concentrations in plasma of memantine were measured at the end of the trial. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02304302. FINDINGS: From May 13, 2015, to July 22, 2020, 185 participants with Down syndrome were assessed for eligibility and 160 (86%) were randomly assigned either memantine (n=81) or placebo (n=79). All participants received their allocated treatment. Linear mixed effect models were fit to data from 149 (81%) participants, 73 in the memantine group and 76 in the placebo group, after 11 people (eight in the memantine group and three in the placebo group) discontinued due to COVID-19 restrictions, illness of their caregiver, adverse events, or low compliance. The primary outcome measure did not differ between groups (CVLT-II-sf total free recall score, change from baseline 0.34 points [95% CI -0.98 to 1.67], p=0.61). Memantine was well tolerated, with infrequent mild-to-moderate adverse events, the most common being viral upper respiratory infection (nine [11%] participants in the memantine group and 12 [15%] in the placebo group) and transient dizziness (eight [10%] in the memantine group and six [8%] in the placebo group). No serious adverse events were observed. Amounts of memantine in plasma were substantially lower than those considered therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease. INTERPRETATION: Memantine was well tolerated, but cognition-enhancing effects were not recorded with a 20 mg/day dose in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome. Exploratory analyses point to a need for future work. FUNDING: Alana Foundation. TRANSLATION: For the Portuguese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.",alzheimer

Changing ongoing RCTs carries risks for biases and threats to validity. To understand the impact of exigent modifications due to COVID-19, we examined several scenarios in symptomatic and disease modification trials that could be made. METHODS: We identified both symptomatic and disease modification Alzheimer disease RCTs as exemplars of those that would be affected by the pandemic and considered the types of changes that sponsors could make to each. We modeled three scenarios for each of the types of trials using existing datasets, adjusting enrollment, follow-ups, and dropouts to examine the potential effects COVID-19-related changes. Simulations were performed that accounted for completion and dropout patterns using linear mixed effects models, modeling time as continuous and categorical. The statistical power of the scenarios was determined. RESULTS: Truncating both symptomatic and disease modification trials led to underpowered trials. By contrast, adapting the trials by extending the treatment period, temporarily stopping treatment, delaying outcomes assessments, and performing remote assessment allowed for increased statistical power nearly to the level originally planned. DISCUSSION: These analyses support the idea that disrupted trials under common scenarios are better continued and extended even in the face of dropouts, treatment disruptions, missing outcomes, and other exigencies and that adaptations can be made that maintain the trials' validity. We suggest some adaptive methods to do this noting that some changes become under-powered to detect the original effect sizes and expected outcomes. These analyses provide insight to better plan trials that are resilient to unexpected changes to the medical, social, and political milieu.",alzheimer

Project VITAL leverages technology and community resources to create a network for connection, engagement, education, and support of individuals with dementia and their caregivers, and explores the impact of these interventions in reducing feelings of social isolation and increasing mood among residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through two phases, 600 personalized Wi-Fi-enabled iN2L tablets were distributed to 300 senior care communities (55% assisted living communities, 37% skilled nursing communities, 6% memory care communities, and 2% adult family-care homes) to connect and engage residents and their families. Different phases also included Project ECHO, a video-based learning platform, Alzheimer's Association virtual and online education and support for family caregivers, evidence-based online professional dementia care staff training and certification, and Virtual Forums designed to explore ways to build sustainable, scalable models to ensure access to support and decrease social isolation in the future. Tablet usage was collected over an 11-month period and an interim survey was designed to assess the effectiveness of the tablets, in preventing social isolation and increasing mood among residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 105 care community staff (whose community used the tablets) completed the survey and overall, these staff showed a high level of agreement to statements indicating that residents struggled with loneliness and mood, and that the tablet was useful in improving loneliness and mood in residents and allowing them to stay in touch with family and friends. Additional positive results were seen through a variety of other responses around the tablets and Project ECHO. Overall, the tablets were shown to be an effective way to engage residents and connect them with friends and family, as well as being a useful tool for staff members. A third phase is currently underway in the homes of people with dementia and their family caregivers, which includes tablets and direct access to Alzheimer's Association virtual and online education and support programs.",alzheimer

One emerging factor that has presented as a serious risk that still requires more research and understanding is the role and effects of Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4). When present, individuals are three times more likely to develop AD in their lifetime. This is due to ApoE4's ability to not only increase amyloid beta plaque aggregation ApoE4 also increases hyperphosphorylation of tau causing neurofibrillary tangles. These two factors are the well-known hallmarks for AD, which increase the importance for ApoE4 research as it affects both major aspects. Treatment for AD has always been an issue due to a variety of factors with only a few approved for use today. These approved treatments are only to ease and supress symptoms rather than treating the disease. Dementia symptoms such as memory loss, language problems, motor skills, irritability and paranoia are all symptoms that destroy patient's ability to function in their communities. Inhibiting ApoE4 and reducing its toxic effects is a promising theory that has the ability to extend AD patients' lifespan and prolong capable brain function limiting brain tissue degradation.",alzheimer

DESIGN: Population-based register study. SETTING: The Norwegian cause of Death Registry and the National Population Register of Norway. PARTICIPANTS: All recorded deaths in Norway from March to May from 2010 to 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate (per 100 000) of all-cause mortality and causes of death in the European Shortlist for Causes of Death from March to May 2020. The rates were age standardised and adjusted to a 100% register coverage and compared with a 95% prediction interval (PI) from linear regression based on corresponding rates for 2010-2019. RESULTS: 113 710 deaths were included, of which 10 226 were from 2020. We did not observe any deviation from predicted total mortality. There were fewer than predicted deaths from chronic lower respiratory diseases excluding asthma (11.4, 95% PI 11.8 to 15.2) and from other non-ischaemic, non-rheumatic heart diseases (13.9, 95% PI 14.5 to 20.2). The death rates were higher than predicted for Alzheimer's disease (7.3, 95% PI 5.5 to 7.3) and diabetes mellitus (4.1, 95% PI 2.1 to 3.4). CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in the frequency of the major causes of death in the first wave of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in Norway compared with corresponding periods 2010-2019. There was an increase in diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's deaths. Reduced mortality due to some heart and lung conditions may be linked to infection control measures.",alzheimer
34902662,Ictogenesis of viral pneumonia: A comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1/H3N2.,Epilepsy Behav,"Several studies reported acute symptomatic seizures as a possible neurological complication of COVID-19 pneumonia. Apart from metabolic imbalances, hypoxia, and fever, other ictogenic mechanisms are likely related to an immune-mediated damage. The same mechanisms are shared by other respiratory viruses. Since neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2 have been questioned, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 has a similar ictogenic potential to other respiratory non-neurotropic viruses. We conducted a retrospective study identifying 1141 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and 146 patients with H1N1/H3N2 pneumonia. We found a similar prevalence of seizures in the two viral pneumonia (1.05% with SARS-CoV-2 vs 2.05% with influenza; p=0.26). We detailed clinical, electroencephalographic, and neuroradiological features of each patient, together with the hypothesized pathogenesis of seizures. Previous epilepsy or pre-existing predisposing conditions (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, stroke, cerebral neoplasia) were found in one-third of patients that experienced seizures, while two-thirds of patients had seizures without known risk factors other than pneumonia in both groups. The prevalence of pre-existing predisposing conditions and disease severity indexes was similar in SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1/H3N2 pneumonia, thus excluding they could act as potential confounders. Considering all the patients with viral pneumonia together, previous epilepsy (p<0.001) and the need for ventilatory support (p<0.001), but not the presence of pre-existing predisposing conditions (p=0.290), were associated with seizure risk. Our study showed that SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses share a similar ictogenic potential. In both these infections, seizures are rare but serious events, and can manifest without pre-existing predisposing conditions, in particular when pneumonia is severe, thus suggesting an interplay between disease severity and host response as a major mechanism of ictogenesis, rather than a virus-specific mechanism.",alzheimer
34886772,"Metabolic Syndrome, Alzheimer's Disease, and Covid 19: A Possible Correlation.",Curr Alzheimer Res,"Age and comorbidities are key indicators of hospital admission, serious illness, and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with age-related comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, NAFLD, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, are more likely to require hospitalization and suffer severe sickness of COVID-19. Patients with Alzheimer's disease and risk factors associated with dementia may also be more vulnerable to serious COVID-19 infection. Peripheral inflammation, including in patients who recover from illness, may promote the course of neurodegenerative disorders through neuroinflammatory pathways. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of COVID-19 on immunity in patients with age-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome and Alzheimer's disease and also to hypothesize the possible correlation between metabolic syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and COVID-19. Identifying the mechanisms that explain the complicated interaction between metabolic syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, COVID-19, inflammation, and immunity could be crucial to designing effective pharmacological therapies and procedures. This study adds to our basic information about the new coronavirus by synthesizing current knowledge of these linkages. To reduce inflammation and enhance immunity, patients should acquire good lifestyle practices. Walking, breathing exercises, and a nutritious diet all help in improving lung capacity and immunity. Future research into novel therapeutics for patients with metabolic syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and COVID-19 inflammation and immunology is encouraged by this paper.",alzheimer

The first is the need to identify the COVID-19 symptoms, genetic polymorphisms and treatment decisions associated with risk of cognitive impairment. The second is the absence of model systems in which to test hypotheses relating infection to cognition. The third is the need for consortia for studying both existing and new longitudinal cohorts in which to monitor long term consequences of COVID-19 infection. A final knowledge gap discussed is the impact of the isolation and lack of social services brought about by quarantine/lockdowns on people living with dementia and their caregivers.

34867295,The Interplay of the Unfolded Protein Response in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Therapeutic Role of Curcumin.,Front Aging Neurosci,"Abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and their aggregation causes inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress. This promotes accumulation of toxic proteins in the body tissues especially brain leading to manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases. The studies suggest that deregulation of proteostasis, particularly aberrant unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling, may be a common morbific process in the development of neurodegeneration. Curcumin, the mixture of low molecular weight polyphenolic compounds from turmeric, Curcuma longa has shown promising response to prevents many diseases including current global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and neurodegenerative disorders. The UPR which correlates positively with neurodegenerative disorders were found affected by curcumin. In this review, we examine the evidence from many model systems illustrating how curcumin interacts with UPR and slows down the development of various neurodegenerative disorders (ND), e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The recent global increase in ND patients indicates that researchers and practitioners will need to develop a new pharmacological drug or treatment to manage and cure these neurodegenerative diseases.",alzheimer

Moreover, dysfunction of AP180 underlies the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms of assembly and, especially, disassembly of AP180/clathrin-containing cages. Here, we identified AP180 as a novel phosphatidic acid (PA)-binding protein from the mouse brain. Intriguingly, liposome binding assays using various phospholipids and PA species revealed that AP180 most strongly bound to 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-PA (18:0/22:6-PA) to a comparable extent as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), which is known to associate with AP180. An AP180 N-terminal homology domain (1-289 aa) interacted with 18:0/22:6-PA, and a lysine-rich motif (K38-K39-K40) was essential for binding. The 18:0/22:6-PA in liposomes in 100 nm diameter showed strong AP180-binding activity at neutral pH. Notably, 18:0/22:6-PA significantly attenuated the interaction of AP180 with clathrin. However, PI(4,5)P2 did not show such an effect. Taken together, these results indicate the novel mechanism by which 18:0/22:6-PA selectively regulates the disassembly of AP180/clathrin-containing cages.",alzheimer
34833630,Future Trends in Semiconducting Gas-Selective Sensing Probes for Skin Diagnostics.,Sensors (Basel),"This paper presents sensor nanotechnologies that can be used for the skin-based gas ""smelling"" of disease. Skin testing may provide rapid and reliable results, using specific ""fingerprints"" or unique patterns for a variety of diseases and conditions. These can include metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and cholesterol-induced heart disease; neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's; quality of life conditions, such as obesity and sleep apnea; pulmonary diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal tract diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome and colitis; cancers, such as breast, lung, pancreatic, and colon cancers; infectious diseases, such as the flu and COVID-19; as well as diseases commonly found in ICU patients, such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and infections of the blood stream. Focusing on the most common gaseous biomarkers in breath and skin, which is nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, and certain abundant volatile organic compounds (acetone, isoprene, ammonia, alcohols, sulfides), it is argued here that effective discrimination between the diseases mentioned above is possible, by capturing the relative sensor output signals from the detection of each of these biomarkers and identifying the distinct breath print for each disease.",alzheimer
34833377,COVID-19 and Alzheimer's Disease: A Literature Review.,Medicina (Kaunas),"There are a number of potential implications for the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) stemming from the global spread of ""SARS-COV-2"". Many studies that were conducted by Cleveland Clinic researchers identified a link between COVID-19 infection and brain abnormalities seen in people with AD. This article explains the association between COVID-19 and AD and how people with AD are affected by COVID-19, whether directly or indirectly. First, this article begins by explaining AD and its types, then giving an overview about COVID-19, its symptoms and the associated complications. Then, direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 on people experiencing AD are discussed briefly. Some management strategies are recommended at the end of this article in addition to a future perspective on this topic. This article concludes by summarizing the main points mentioned about the association between COVID-19 and AD.",alzheimer
34831271,"Novel Galectin-3 Roles in Neurogenesis, Inflammation and Neurological Diseases.",Cells,"Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is an evolutionarily conserved and multifunctional protein that drives inflammation in disease. Gal-3's role in the central nervous system has been less studied than in the immune system. However, recent studies show it exacerbates Alzheimer's disease and is upregulated in a large variety of brain injuries, while loss of Gal-3 function can diminish symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Several novel molecular pathways for Gal-3 were recently uncovered. It is a natural ligand for TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells), TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4), and IR (insulin receptor). Gal-3 regulates a number of pathways including stimulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and modulating Wnt signalling in a context-dependent manner. Gal-3 typically acts in pathology but is now known to affect subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the healthy brain. Despite its myriad interactors, Gal-3 has surprisingly specific and important functions in regulating SVZ neurogenesis in disease. Gal-1, a similar lectin often co-expressed with Gal-3, also has profound effects on brain pathology and adult neurogenesis. Remarkably, Gal-3's carbohydrate recognition domain bears structural similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein necessary for cell entry. Gal-3 can be targeted pharmacologically and is a valid target for several diseases involving brain inflammation. The wealth of molecular pathways now known further suggest its modulation could be therapeutically useful.",alzheimer
34831104,Instructions for Flow Cytometric Detection of ASC Specks as a Readout of Inflammasome Activation in Human Blood.,Cells,"Inflammasome activation is linked to the aggregation of the adaptor protein ASC into a multiprotein complex, known as the ASC speck. Redistribution of cytosolic ASC to this complex has been widely used as a readout for inflammasome activation and precedes the downstream proteolytic release of the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1beta and IL-18. Although inflammasomes are important for many diseases such as periodic fever syndromes, COVID-19, gout, sepsis, atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, only a little knowledge exists on the precise and cell type specific occurrence of inflammasome activation in patient samples ex vivo. In this report, we provide detailed information about the optimal conditions to reliably identify inflammasome activated monocytes by ASC speck formation using a modified flow cytometric method introduced by Sester et al. in 2015. Since no protocol for optimal sample processing exists, we tested human blood samples for various conditions including anticoagulant, time and temperature, the effect of one freeze-thaw cycle for PBMC storage, and the fast generation of a positive control. We believe that this flow cytometric protocol will help researchers to perform high quality translational research in multicenter studies, and therefore provide a basis for investigating the role of the inflammasome in the pathogenesis of various diseases.",alzheimer
34812418,COVID-19 Artificial Intelligence Diagnosis Using Only Cough Recordings.,IEEE Open J Eng Med Biol,"Goal: We hypothesized that COVID-19 subjects, especially including asymptomatics, could be accurately discriminated only from a forced-cough cell phone recording using Artificial Intelligence. To train our MIT Open Voice model we built a data collection pipeline of COVID-19 cough recordings through our website (opensigma.mit.edu) between April and May 2020 and created the largest audio COVID-19 cough balanced dataset reported to date with 5,320 subjects. Methods: We developed an AI speech processing framework that leverages acoustic biomarker feature extractors to pre-screen for COVID-19 from cough recordings, and provide a personalized patient saliency map to longitudinally monitor patients in real-time, non-invasively, and at essentially zero variable cost. Cough recordings are transformed with Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient and inputted into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture made up of one Poisson biomarker layer and 3 pre-trained ResNet50's in parallel, outputting a binary pre-screening diagnostic. Our CNN-based models have been trained on 4256 subjects and tested on the remaining 1064 subjects of our dataset. Transfer learning was used to learn biomarker features on larger datasets, previously successfully tested in our Lab on Alzheimer's, which significantly improves the COVID-19 discrimination accuracy of our architecture. Results: When validated with subjects diagnosed using an official test, the model achieves COVID-19 sensitivity of 98.5% with a specificity of 94.2% (AUC: 0.97). For asymptomatic subjects it achieves sensitivity of 100% with a specificity of 83.2%. Conclusions: AI techniques can produce a free, non-invasive, real-time, any-time, instantly distributable, large-scale COVID-19 asymptomatic screening tool to augment current approaches in containing the spread of COVID-19. Practical use cases could be for daily screening of students, workers, and public as schools, jobs, and transport reopen, or for pool testing to quickly alert of outbreaks in groups. General speech biomarkers may exist that cover several disease categories, as we demonstrated using the same ones for COVID-19 and Alzheimer's.",alzheimer

34806608,Caregiver Tele-Assistance for Reduction of Emotional Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Psychological Support to Caregivers of People with Dementia: The Italian Experience.,J Alzheimers Dis,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic worsened vulnerability of patients with dementia (PWD). This new reality associated with government restriction and isolation worsened stress burden and psychological frailties in PWD caregivers. OBJECTIVE: To give tele-psychological support to caregivers and evaluate the effect of this intervention by quantifying stress burden and quality of life during the first COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: 50 caregivers were divided into two groups: ""Caregiver-focused group"" (Cg) and ""Patient-focused group"" (Pg). Both groups received telephone contact every 2 weeks over a 28-week period, but the content of the call was different: in Cg, caregivers answered questions about the state of the PWD but also explored their own emotional state, stress burden, and quality of life. In Pg instead, telephone contacts were focused only on the PWD, and no evaluation regarding the caregiver mood or state of stress was made. Psychometric scales were administered to evaluate COVID-19 impact, stress burden, and quality of life. RESULTS: Considering the time of intervention, from baseline (W0) to W28, Zarit Burden Interview and Quality of Life-caregiver questionnaires remained unchanged in Cg as compared with baseline (p > 0.05), whereas they worsened significantly in Pg (p < 0.01), showing increased stress over time and decreased quality of life in this group. Moreover, Impact on Event Scale values improved over the weeks in Cg (p = 0.015), while they remained unchanged in Pg (p = 0.483). CONCLUSION: Caregivers who received telephone support about their mood and stress burden did not worsen their psychological state during the time of intervention, as did instead those who did not get such support.",alzheimer

Our case highlights the need to examine patients with cognitive symptoms following COVID-19 comprehensively. A detailed assessment combining clinical, cognitive, and biomarker studies may help disentangle the underlying mechanisms associated with cognitive dysfunction in each case. The investigation of neurodegenerative processes in an early stage, especially in older patients, is probably warranted.",alzheimer
34622475,Association of proton-pump inhibitor use with adverse health outcomes: A systematic umbrella review of meta-analyses of cohort studies and randomised controlled trials.,Br J Clin Pharmacol,"AIMS: The aim was to perform an umbrella review to summarise the existing evidence on proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use and adverse outcomes and to grade the certainty of evidence. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched up to July 2021 for meta-analyses of cohort studies and/or randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Summary effect sizes from a random-effects model, between-study heterogeneity, 95% prediction interval, small-study effect, excess significance and credibility ceilings were devised to classify the credibility of evidence from meta-analyses of cohort studies, whereas the GRADE approach was used for meta-analyses of RCTs. RESULTS: In meta-analyses of cohort studies, 52 of the 91 examined associations were statistically significant (P </= .05). Convincing evidence emerged from main analysis for the association between PPI use and risk of all-site fracture and chronic kidney disease in the elderly population. However, none of these associations remained supported by convincing evidence after sensitivity analyses. The use of PPI is also associated with an increased risk of mortality due to COVID-19 infection and other related adverse outcomes, but the quality of evidence was weak. In meta-analyses of RCTs, 38 of the 63 examined associations were statistically significant. However, no associations were supported by high or moderate-quality evidence. CONCLUSION: This study's findings imply that most putative adverse outcomes associated with PPI use may not be supported by high-quality evidence and are likely to have been affected by underlying confounding factors. Future research is needed to confirm the causal association between PPI use and risk of fracture and chronic kidney disease.",bald
33972825,"From Precision Metapharmacology to Patient Empowerment: Delivery of Self-Care Practices for Epilepsy, Pain, Depression and Cancer Using Digital Health Technologies.",Front Pharmacol,"To improve long-term outcomes of therapies for chronic diseases, health promotion and lifestyle modifications are the most promising and sustainable strategies. In addition, advances in digital technologies provide new opportunities to address limitations of drug-based treatments, such as medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, drug resistance, drug shortages, affordability, and accessibility. Pharmaceutical drugs and biologics can be combined with digital health technologies, including mobile medical apps (digital therapeutics), which offer additional clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness. Promises of drug+digital combination therapies are recognized by pharmaceutical and digital health companies, opening opportunities for integrating pharmacotherapies with non-pharmacological interventions (metapharmacology). Herein we present unique features of digital health technologies which can deliver personalized self-care modalities such as breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, yoga, physical activity, adequate sleep, listening to preferred music, forgiveness and gratitude. Clinical studies reveal how aforementioned complimentary practices may support treatments of epilepsy, chronic pain, depression, cancer, and other chronic diseases. This article also describes how digital therapies delivering ""medicinal"" self-care and other non-pharmacological interventions can also be personalized by accounting for: 1) genetic risks for comorbidities, 2) adverse childhood experiences, 3) increased risks for viral infections such as seasonal influenza, or COVID-19, and 4) just-in-time stressful and traumatic circumstances. Development and implementation of personalized pharmacological-behavioral combination therapies (precision metapharmacology) require aligning priorities of key stakeholders including patients, research communities, healthcare industry, regulatory and funding agencies. In conclusion, digital technologies enable integration of pharmacotherapies with self-care, lifestyle interventions and patient empowerment, while concurrently advancing patient-centered care, integrative medicine and digital health ecosystems.",bald
33811809,BET inhibition blocks inflammation-induced cardiac dysfunction and SARS-CoV-2 infection.,Cell,"Cardiac injury and dysfunction occur in COVID-19 patients and increase the risk of mortality. Causes are ill defined but could be through direct cardiac infection and/or inflammation-induced dysfunction. To identify mechanisms and cardio-protective drugs, we use a state-of-the-art pipeline combining human cardiac organoids with phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA sequencing. We identify an inflammatory ""cytokine-storm"", a cocktail of interferon gamma, interleukin 1beta, and poly(I:C), induced diastolic dysfunction. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 is activated along with a viral response that is consistent in both human cardiac organoids (hCOs) and hearts of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice. Bromodomain and extraterminal family inhibitors (BETi) recover dysfunction in hCOs and completely prevent cardiac dysfunction and death in a mouse cytokine-storm model. Additionally, BETi decreases transcription of genes in the viral response, decreases ACE2 expression, and reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection of cardiomyocytes. Together, BETi, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakthrough designated drug, apabetalone, are promising candidates to prevent COVID-19 mediated cardiac damage.",bald
33779522,Facilitators and challenges in the adoption of a virtual nurse visit in the home health setting.,Home Health Care Serv Q,"The COVID-19 pandemic created an opportunity to incorporate nurse-led virtual home care visits into heart failure patients' plan of care. As a supplemental nurse visit to traditional in-person home visits, the Virtual Nurse Visit (VNV) service was deployed using Zoom teleconferencing technology enabling telehealth nurses to remotely communicate, assess, and educate their patients. This mixed methods study explored heart failure patients' abilities, experience, and satisfaction to use and adopt a virtual nurse visit. Sociodemographic, semi-structured interview questions, and the System Usability Scale data were collected. Thirty-four participants completed the study. Over half of participants perceived the VNV usable and four qualitative themes emerged: perceived safety during COVID-19, preferences for care delivery, user experiences and challenges, and satisfaction with the VNV service. Findings from this study builds the science around telehealth that will inform future studies examining this type of nurse-led virtual visit and subsequent patient outcomes.",bald
33716858,The Impact of Writing About Gratitude on the Intention to Engage in Prosocial Behaviors During the COVID-19 Outbreak.,Front Psychol,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly swept the globe leaving a devastating trail of lost human lives and leading to a public health and economic crisis. With this in mind, prosociality has been heralded as a potential important factor to overcome the negative effects of the pandemic. As such, in this study, we examined the effectiveness of a brief reflexive writing exercise about recent experiences of gratitude on individuals' intentions to engage in prosocial behaviors using a sample of 253 participants living in Portugal and 280 participants living in Brazil. Participants were randomly assigned to either a condition in which they were asked to write about recent experiences of gratitude or a control group in which they were asked to write about daily tasks. We predicted that the gratitude intervention would increase state gratitude and, consequently, increase positive affect and empathic concern, and decrease negative affect, leading to increased intentions to engage in prosocial behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. A moderated serial-parallel mediation analysis, in which we controlled for gender, age, and level of religiosity, indicated that our manipulation led to increases in state gratitude, which in turn increased positive emotions and empathic concern, leading to increased prosocial intentions in both countries. A content analysis of participants' responses in the gratitude group revealed that relationships with others and health and well-being were the central themes of their gratitude experiences during the COVID-19 global pandemic.",bald
33436494,Women's experiences of mistreatment during childbirth and their satisfaction with care: findings from a multicountry community-based study in four countries.,BMJ Glob Health,"INTRODUCTION: Experiences of care and satisfaction are intrinsically linked, as user's experiences of care may directly impact satisfaction, or indirectly impact user's expectations and values. Both experiences of care and satisfaction are important to measure so that quality can be monitored and improved. Globally, women experience mistreatment during childbirth at facilities; however, there is limited evidence exploring the mistreatment and women's satisfaction with care during childbirth. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey within the WHO study 'How women are treated during facility-based childbirth' exploring the mistreatment of women during childbirth in Ghana, Guinea, Myanmar and Nigeria. Women's experiences of mistreatment and satisfaction with care during childbirth was explored. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was conducted to evaluate the association between mistreatment, women's overall satisfaction with the care they received, and whether they would recommend the facility to others. RESULTS: 2672 women were included in this analysis. Despite over one-third of women reporting experience of mistreatment (35.4%), overall satisfaction for services received and recommendation of the facility to others was high, 88.4% and 90%, respectively. Women who reported experiences of mistreatment were more likely to report lower satisfaction with care: women were more likely to be satisfied if they did not experience verbal abuse (adjusted OR (AOR) 4.52, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.85), or had short waiting times (AOR 5.12, 95% CI 3.94 to 6.65). Women who did not experience any physical or verbal abuse or discrimination were more likely to recommend the facility to others (AOR 3.89, 95% CI 2.98 to 5.06). CONCLUSION: Measuring both women's experiences and their satisfaction with care are critical to assess quality and provide actionable evidence for quality improvement. These measures can enable health systems to identify and respond to root causes contributing to measures of satisfaction.",bald
33285543,High Prevalence of Deep Venous Thrombosis in Non-Severe COVID-19 Patients Hospitalized for a Neurovascular Disease.,Cerebrovasc Dis Extra,"INTRODUCTION: Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection induces COVID-19 along with venous thromboembolic occurrences particularly in intensive care units. For non-severe COVID-19 patients affected by neurovascular diseases, the prevalence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is unknown. The aim of our study was to report data obtained after systematic Doppler ultrasound scanning (DUS) of lower limbs in such patients. METHODS: Between March 20 and May 2, 2020, the deep venous system of 13 consecutive patients diagnosed with neurovascular diseases and non-severe COVID-19 was investigated with a systematic bedside DUS. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study including 9 acute ischaemic strokes, 1 occlusion of the ophthalmic artery, 1 transient ischaemic attack, 1 cerebral venous thrombosis and 1 haemorrhagic stroke. On admission, the median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was of 6 (IQR, 0-20). During the first week after admission, and despite thromboprophylaxis, we found a prevalence of 38.5% of asymptomatic calves' DVT (n = 5). One patient developed a symptomatic pulmonary embolism and 2 other patients died during hospitalization. The outcome was positive for the other patients with a discharge median NIHSS score of 1 (IQR, 0-11). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Despite thromboprophylaxis, systematic bedside DUS showed a high prevalence (38.5%) of asymptomatic DVT in non-severe COVID-19 patients suffering from a neurovascular disease. In the absence of a reliable marker of DVT, we suggest that this non-invasive investigation could be an interesting tool to monitor peripheral venous thrombotic complications in such patients.",bald
33234502,Labour companionship and women's experiences of mistreatment during childbirth: results from a multi-country community-based survey.,BMJ Glob Health,"BACKGROUND: Evidence has shown the benefits of labour companions during childbirth. Few studies have documented the relationship between the absence of labour companions and mistreatment of women during childbirth in low-income and middle-income countries using a standardised tool. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the WHO multi-country study on how women are treated during childbirth, where a cross-sectional community survey was conducted with women up to 8 weeks after childbirth in Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Myanmar. Descriptive analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine whether labour companionship was associated with various types of mistreatment. RESULTS: Of 2672 women, about half (50.4%) reported the presence of a labour companion. Approximately half (49.6%) of these women reported that the timing of support was during labour and after childbirth and most of the labour companions (47.0%) were their family members. Across Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria, women without a labour companion were more likely to report physical abuse, non-consented medical procedures and poor communication compared with women with a labour companion. However, there were country-level variations. In Guinea, the absence of labour companionship was associated with any physical abuse, verbal abuse, or stigma or discrimination (adjusted OR (AOR) 3.6, 1.9-6.9) and non-consented vaginal examinations (AOR 3.2, 1.6-6.4). In Ghana, it was associated with non-consented vaginal examinations (AOR 2.3, 1.7-3.1) and poor communication (AOR 2.0, 1.3-3.2). In Nigeria, it was associated with longer wait times (AOR 0.6, 0.3-0.9). CONCLUSION: Labour companionship is associated with lower levels of some forms of mistreatment that women experience during childbirth, depending on the setting. Further work is needed to ascertain how best to implement context-specific labour companionship to ensure benefits while maintaining women's choices and autonomy.",bald

According to the National Health Security Agency (ANSS), which is the national body responsible for managing epidemics and pandemics, 1927 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed, 11 deaths with more than 4000 contact subjects. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the activities of the cardiology department of the Ignace Deen National Hospital at the Conakry University Hospital. This was a descriptive retrospective study from January 2020 to April 2020, focusing on consultation and hospitalisation activities in the cardiology department of Ignace Deen National Hospital at Conakry University Hospital. The study consisted of assessing the impact of the pandemic on patient use of the service during the first weeks of the pandemic. We recorded the frequency of consultations and hospitalisations from March to April 2020, which we compared to the frequency of consultations and hospitalisations in January and February 2020. During this study from March to April 2020, we identified 130 patients in consultation against 450 patients for the two months preceding the official declaration of the pandemic in Guinea, a drop of 71.1% (320 patients). The same remark was made in hospitalisation with a drop of 75% (35 patients against 140 for the two months preceding the pandemic). At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Guinea, it is clear that there has been a rapid and significant drop in the effective use of the cardiology service.",bald
34998222,BEMD-3DCNN-based method for COVID-19 detection.,Comput Biol Med,"The coronavirus outbreak continues to spread around the world and no one knows when it will stop. Therefore, from the first day of the identification of the virus in Wuhan, China, scientists have launched numerous research projects to understand the nature of the virus, how to detect it, and search for the most effective medicine to help and protect patients. Importantly, a rapid diagnostic and detection system is a priority and should be developed to stop COVID-19 from spreading. Medical imaging techniques have been used for this purpose. Current research is focused on exploiting different backbones like VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, or combining them to detect COVID-19. By using these backbones many aspects cannot be analyzed like the spatial and contextual information in the images, although this information can be useful for more robust detection performance. In this paper, we used 3D representation of the data as input for the proposed 3DCNN-based deep learning model. The process includes using the Bi-dimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEMD) technique to decompose the original image into IMFs, and then building a video of these IMF images. The formed video is used as input for the 3DCNN model to classify and detect the COVID-19 virus. The 3DCNN model consists of a 3D VGG-16 backbone followed by a Context-aware attention (CAA) module, and then fully connected layers for classification. Each CAA module takes the feature maps of different blocks of the backbone, which allows learning from different feature maps. In our experiments, we used 6484 X-ray images, of which 1802 were COVID-19 positive cases, 1910 normal cases, and 2772 pneumonia cases. The experiment results showed that our proposed technique achieved the desired results on the selected dataset. Additionally, the use of the 3DCNN model with contextual information processing exploited CAA networks to achieve better performance.",medicine
34997957,COVID-19: a trigger for severe thrombotic microangiopathy in a patient with complement gene variant.,Rom J Intern Med,"The evidence regarding thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) related to Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with complement gene mutations as a cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) are limited. We presented a case of a 23-year-old male patient admitted with an asymptomatic form of COVID-19, but with uncontrolled hypertension and AKI. Kidney biopsy showed severe lesions of TMA. In evolution patient had persistent microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, decreased level of haptoglobin and increased LDH level. Decreased complement C3 level and the presence of schistocytes were found for the first time after biopsy. Kidney function progressively decreased and the patient remained hemodialysis dependent. Complement work-up showed a heterozygous variant with unknown significance in complement factor I (CFI) c.-13G>A, affecting the 5' UTR region of the gene. In addition, the patient was found to be heterozygous for the complement factor H (CFH) H3 haplotype (involving the rare alleles of c.-331C>T, Q672Q and E936D polymorphisms) reported as a risk factor of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. This case of AKI associated with severe TMA and secondary hemolytic uremic syndrome highlights the importance of genetic risk modifiers in the alternative pathway dysregulation of the complement in the setting of COVID-19, even in asymptomatic forms.",medicine

Analysis of cognitive biases in clinical cases during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Intern Emerg Med,"Cognitive biases are systematic cognitive distortions, which can affect clinical reasoning. The aim of this study was to unravel the most common cognitive biases encountered in in the peculiar context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Case study research design. Primary care. Single centre (Division of General Internal Medicine, University Hospitals of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland). A short survey was sent to all primary care providers (N = 169) taking care of hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19. Participants were asked to describe cases in which they felt that their clinical reasoning was ""disrupted"" because of the pandemic context. Seven case were sufficiently complete to be analysed. A qualitative analysis of the clinical cases was performed and a bias grid encompassing 17 well-known biases created. The clinical cases were analyzed to assess for the likelihood (highly likely, plausible, not likely) of the different biases for each case. The most common biases were: ""anchoring bias"", ""confirmation bias"", ""availability bias"", and ""cognitive dissonance"". The pandemic context is a breeding ground for the emergence of cognitive biases, which can influence clinical reasoning and lead to errors. Awareness of these cognitive mechanisms could potentially reduce biases and improve clinical reasoning. Moreover, the analysis of cognitive biases can offer an insight on the functioning of the clinical reasoning process in the midst of the pandemic crisis.",medicine

A decrease in pH and a shift in the electrolyte balance of blood plasma were revealed in all studied groups and were most pronounced in patients with cardiovascular pathologies with allergy to statin. It was found that low pH promotes destruction of lipid components of the erythrocyte membranes in patients with chronic pathologies, which was seen from a decrease in Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity and significant hyponatrenemia. In patients with cardiovascular pathologies and allergy to statins, erythrocyte membranes were most sensitive to a decrease in pH, while erythrocyte membranes of obese patients showed the greatest resistance to low pH and oxidative stress.",medicine
34996048,Immunogenicity of Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine in Vietnamese Health-Care Workers.,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"We studied the immunogenicity of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in health-care workers of a major infectious diseases hospital in Vietnam. We measured neutralizing antibodies before and 14 days after each dose, and at day 28 and month 3 after dose 1. A total of 554 workers (136 men and 418 women; age range, 22-71 years; median age, 36 years) participated with the study. Of the 144 participants selected for follow-up after dose 1, 104 and 94 gave blood for antibody measurement at weeks 6 and 8, and at month 3 after dose 1, respectively. The window time between the two doses was 6 weeks. At baseline, none had detectable neutralizing antibodies. After dose 1, the proportion of participants with detectable neutralizing antibodies increased from 27.3% (151 of 554) at day 14 to 78.0% (432 of 554) at day 28. Age correlated negatively with the development and the levels of neutralizing antibodies. However, at day 28, these differences were less profound, and women had a greater seroconversion rate and greater levels of neutralizing antibodies than men. After dose 2, these age and gender associations were not observable. In addition, the proportion of study participants with detectable neutralizing antibodies increased from 70.2% (73 of 104) before dose 2 (week 6, after dose 1) to 98.1% (102 of 104) 14 days later. At month 3, neutralizing antibodies decreased and 94.7% (89 of 94) of the study participants remained seropositive. The Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is immunogenic in Vietnamese health-care workers. These data are critical to informing the deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine in Vietnam and in Southeast Asia, where vaccination coverage remains inadequate.",medicine
34995988,Health outcomes in redlined versus non-redlined neighborhoods: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Soc Sci Med,"BACKGROUND: Redlining was a racialized zoning practice in the U.S. that blocked fair access to home loans during the 1930s, and recent research is illuminating health problems in the current residents of these historically redlined areas. However, this work has not yet been holistically summarized. Here, we present the first systematic review and meta-analysis comparing health outcomes in redlined versus non-redlined neighborhoods in U.S. cities. METHODS: We extracted relevant articles in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and Science Direct databases published from January 2010 to September 2021. RESULTS: The search revealed 12 studies on preterm births (n = 3), gunshot-related injuries (n = 2), cancer (n = 1), asthma (n = 1), self-rated health (n = 1), multiple health outcomes (n = 2), heat-related outcomes (n = 1) and COVID-19 incidence and mortality (n = 1). A meta-analysis of three studies found the odds of having preterm birth was significantly higher (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.88; p = 0.02) among women living in redlined areas compared to those in non-redlined areas. Review of other outcomes revealed that gunshot-related injuries, asthma, heat-related outcomes, and multiple chronic conditions were worse in redlined areas, while associations with cancer varied by cancer type. In terms of cause-specific mortality, one study revealed no link between residential redlining and infant mortality rate, while one study on COVID-19 outcomes was inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this review presents evidence that living in historically redlined areas is associated with increased risk of multiple serious adverse health outcomes. Further research on mechanisms, remediation, and neighborhood-level interventions is needed to strengthen the understanding of the impacts of redlining on health.",medicine

34994081,Decreased memory B cells frequencies in COVID-19 Delta variant vaccine breakthrough infection.,EMBO Mol Med,"The SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant is capable of infecting vaccinated persons. An open question remains as to whether deficiencies in specific vaccine-elicited immune responses result in susceptibility to vaccine breakthrough infection. We investigated 55 vaccine breakthrough infection cases (mostly Delta) in Singapore, comparing them against 86 vaccinated close contacts who did not contract infection. Vaccine breakthrough cases showed lower memory B cell frequencies against SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). Compared to plasma antibodies, antibodies secreted by memory B cells retained a higher fraction of neutralizing properties against the Delta variant. Inflammatory cytokines including IL-1beta and TNF were lower in vaccine breakthrough infections than primary infection of similar disease severity, underscoring the usefulness of vaccination in preventing inflammation. This report highlights the importance of memory B cells against vaccine breakthrough, and suggests that lower memory B cell levels may be a correlate of risk for Delta vaccine breakthrough infection.",medicine

OBJECTIVE: To describe the changes in management, control, and outcomes in older people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated with the shift from in-person to virtual visits. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: In veterans aged >/= 65 years with T2D, we assessed the rates of visits (in person, virtual), A1c measurements, antidiabetic deintensification/intensification, ER visits and hospitalizations (for hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, other causes), and A1c level, in March 2020 and April-November 2020 (pandemic period). We used negative binomial regression to assess change over time (reference: pre-pandemic period, July 2018 to February 2020), by baseline Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI; > 2 vs. <= 2) and A1c level. KEY RESULTS: Among 740,602 veterans (mean age 74.2 [SD 6.6] years), there were 55% (95% CI 52-58%) fewer in-person visits, 821% (95% CI 793-856%) more virtual visits, 6% (95% CI 1-11%) fewer A1c measurements, and 14% (95% CI 10-17%) more treatment intensification during the pandemic, relative to baseline. Patients with CCI > 2 had a 14% (95% CI 12-16%) smaller relative increase in virtual visits than those with CCI <= 2. We observed a seasonality of A1c level and treatment modification, but no association of either with the pandemic. After a decrease at the beginning of the pandemic, there was a rebound in other-cause (but not hypo- and hyperglycemia-related) ER visits and hospitalizations from June to November 2020. CONCLUSION: Despite a shift to virtual visits and a decrease in A1c measurement during the pandemic, we observed no association with A1c level or short-term T2D-related outcomes, providing some reassurance about the adequacy of virtual visits. Further studies should assess the longer-term effects of shifting to virtual visits in different populations to help individualize care, improve efficiency, and maintain appropriate care while reducing overuse.",medicine
34993862,Association of Race and Neighborhood Disadvantage with Patient Engagement in a Home-Based COVID-19 Remote Monitoring Program.,J Gen Intern Med,"BACKGROUND: COVID-positive outpatients may benefit from remote monitoring, but such a program often relies on smartphone apps. This may introduce racial and socio-economic barriers to participation. Offering multiple methods for participation may address these barriers. OBJECTIVES: (1) To examine associations of race and neighborhood disadvantage with patient retention in a monitoring program offering two participation methods. (2) To measure the association of the program with emergency department visits and hospital admissions. DESIGN: Retrospective propensity-matched cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: COVID-positive outpatients at a single university-affiliated healthcare system and propensity-matched controls. INTERVENTIONS: A home monitoring program providing daily symptom tracking via patient portal app or telephone calls. MAIN MEASURES: Among program enrollees, retention (until 14 days, symptom resolution, or hospital admission) by race and neighborhood disadvantage, with stratification by program arm. In enrollees versus matched controls, emergency department utilization and hospital admission within 30 days. KEY RESULTS: There were 7592 enrolled patients and 9710 matched controls. Black enrollees chose the telephone arm more frequently than White enrollees (68% versus 44%, p = 0.009), as did those from more versus less disadvantaged neighborhoods (59% versus 43%, p = 0.02). Retention was similar in Black enrollees and White enrollees (63% versus 62%, p = 0.76) and in more versus less disadvantaged neighborhoods (63% versus 62%, p = 0.44). When stratified by program arm, Black enrollees had lower retention than White enrollees in the app arm (49% versus 55%, p = 0.01), but not in the telephone arm (69% versus 71%, p = 0.12). Compared to controls, enrollees more frequently visited the emergency department (HR 1.71 [95% CI 1.56-1.87]) and were admitted to the hospital (HR 1.16 [95% CI 1.02-1.31]). CONCLUSIONS: In a COVID-19 remote patient monitoring program, Black enrollees preferentially selected, and had higher retention in, telephone- over app-based monitoring. As a result, overall retention was similar between races. Remote monitoring programs with multiple modes may reduce barriers to participation.",medicine

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of the pandemic on HCWs, and the relationship between HCW mental health and demographics, occupational factors, and COVID-19 concerns. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey in an urban medical center (September-November 2020) in Baltimore, MD, in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 605 HCWs (physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, physician assistants, patient care technicians, respiratory therapists, social workers, mental health therapists, and case managers). MAIN MEASURES: Measures of mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire-2, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, PROMIS Sleep Disturbance 4a, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Maslach Burnout Inventory-2 item, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2 item), demographics, occupational factors, and COVID-19 related concerns. KEY RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of 1198 HCWs responded to the survey and 14.2% reported depression, 43.1% mild or higher anxiety, 31.6% sleep disturbance, 22.3% posttraumatic stress symptoms, 21.6% depersonalization, 46.0% emotional exhaustion, and 23.1% lower resilience. Relative to HCWs providing in-person care to COVID-19 infected patients none of their working days, those doing so all or most days were more likely to experience worse depression (adjusted odds ratio, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.3-11.7), anxiety (aOR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4-6.3), possible PTSD symptoms (aOR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1-5.8), and higher burnout (aOR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1-6.0). Worse mental health in several domains was associated with higher health fear (aORs ranged from 2.2 to 5.0), job stressors (aORs ranged from 1.9 to 4.0), perceived social stigma/avoidance (aORs ranged from 1.8 to 2.9), and workplace safety concerns (aORs ranged from 1.8 to 2.8). CONCLUSIONS: US HCWs experienced significant mental health symptoms eight months into the pandemic. More time spent providing in-person care to COVID-19-infected patients and greater COVID-19-related concerns were consistently associated with worse mental health.",medicine
34993853,An Analysis COVID-19 in Mexico: a Prediction of Severity.,J Gen Intern Med,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a mild illness in most cases; forecasting COVID-19-associated mortality and the demand for hospital beds and ventilators are crucial for rationing countries' resources. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 in Mexico and to develop and validate a score to predict severity in patients with COVID-19 infection in Mexico. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. PARTICIPANTS: We included 1,435,316 patients with COVID-19 included before the first vaccine application in Mexico; 725,289 (50.5%) were men; patient's mean age (standard deviation (SD)) was 43.9 (16.9) years; 21.7% of patients were considered severe COVID-19 because they were hospitalized, died or both. MAIN MEASURES: We assessed demographic variables, smoking status, pregnancy, and comorbidities. Backward selection of variables was used to derive and validate a model to predict the severity of COVID-19. KEY RESULTS: We developed a logistic regression model with 14 main variables, splines, and interactions that may predict the probability of COVID-19 severity (area under the curve for the validation cohort = 82.4%). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a new model able to predict the severity of COVID-19 in Mexican patients. This model could be helpful in epidemiology and medical decisions.",medicine
34993740,Multi-scale mechanism of antiviral drug-alike phytoligands from Ayurveda in managing COVID-19 and associated metabolic comorbidities: insights from network pharmacology.,Mol Divers,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which emerged in Wuhan, China, is continuously spreading worldwide, creating a huge burden on public health and economy. Ayurveda, the oldest healing schema of Traditional Indian Medicinal (TIM) system, is considered as a promising CAM therapy to combat various diseases/ disorders. To explore the regulatory mechanisms of 3038 Ayurvedic herbs (AHs) against SARS-CoV-2, in this study, multi-targeting and synergistic actions of constituent 34,472 phytochemicals (APCs) are investigated using a comprehensive approach comprising of network pharmacology and molecular docking. Immunomodulatory prospects of antiviral drug-alike potentially effective phytochemicals (PEPs) are presented as a special case study, highlighting the importance of 6 AHs in eliciting the antiviral immunity. By evaluating binding affinity of 292 PEPs against 24 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we develop and analyze a high-confidence ""bi-regulatory network"" of 115 PEPs having ability to regulate protein targets in both virus and its host human system. Furthermore, mechanistic actions of PEPs against cardiovascular complications, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are also investigated to address the regulatory potential of AHs in dealing with COVID-19-associated metabolic comorbidities. The study further reports 12 PEPs as promising source of COVID-19 comorbidity regulators.",medicine
34993712,"Essential metals, vitamins and antioxidant enzyme activities in COVID-19 patients and their potential associations with the disease severity.",Biometals,"The role of micronutrient deficiency in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 has been reviewed in the literature; however, the data are limited and conflicting. This study investigated the association between the status of essential metals, vitamins, and antioxidant enzyme activities in COVID-19 patients and disease severity. We recruited 155 patients, who were grouped into four classes based on the Adults guideline for the Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 at King Faisal Specialist & Research Centre (KFSH&RC): asymptomatic (N = 16), mild (N = 49), moderate (N = 68), and severe (N = 22). We measured serum levels of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), vitamin D3, vitamin A, vitamin E, total antioxidant capacity, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Among the patients, 30%, 25%, 37%, and 68% were deficient in Se (< 70.08 microg/L), Zn (< 0.693 microg/mL), vitamin A (< 0.343 microg/mL), and vitamin D3 (< 20.05 microg/L), respectively, and SOD activity was low. Among the patients, 28% had elevated Cu levels (> 1.401 microg/mL, KFSH&RC upper reference limit). Multiple regression analysis revealed an 18% decrease in Se levels in patients with severe symptoms, which increased to 30% after adjusting the model for inflammatory markers. Regardless of inflammation, Se was independently associated with COVID-19 severity. In contrast, a 50% increase in Cu levels was associated with disease severity only after adjusting for C-reactive protein, reflecting its possible inflammatory and pro-oxidant role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. We noted an imbalance in the ratio between Cu and Zn, with ~ 83% of patients having a Cu/Zn ratio > 1, which is an indicator of inflammation. Cu-to-Zn ratio increased to 45% in patients with mild symptoms and 34%-36% in patients with moderate symptoms compared to asymptomatic patients. These relationships were only obtained when one of the laboratory parameters (lymphocyte or monocyte) or inflammatory markers (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) was included in the regression model. These findings suggest that Cu/Zn might further exacerbate inflammation in COVID-19 patients and might be synergistically associated with disease severity. A 23% decrease in vitamin A was seen in patients with severe symptoms, which disappeared after adjusting for inflammatory markers. This finding may highlight the potential role of inflammation in mediating the relationship between COVID-19 severity and vitamin A levels. Despite our patients' low status of Zn, vitamin D3, and antioxidant enzyme (SOD), there is no evidence of their role in COVID-19 progression. Our findings reinforce that deficiency or excess of certain micronutrients plays a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. More studies are required to support our results.",medicine
34993416,Repurposable drugs for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza sepsis with scRNA-seq data targeting post-transcription modifications.,Precis Clin Med,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted almost every part of human life worldwide, posing a massive threat to human health. The lack of time for new drug discovery and the urgent need for rapid disease control to reduce mortality have led to a search for quick and effective alternatives to novel therapeutics, for example drug repurposing. To identify potentially repurposable drugs, we employed a systematic approach to mine candidates from U.S. FDA-approved drugs and preclinical small-molecule compounds by integrating gene expression perturbation data for chemicals from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures project with a publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from patients with mild and severe COVID-19 (GEO: GSE145926, public data available and accessed on 22 April 2020). We identified 281 FDA-approved drugs that have the potential to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, 16 of which are currently undergoing clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy against COVID-19. We experimentally tested and demonstrated the inhibitory effects of tyrphostin-AG-1478 and brefeldin-a, two chemical inhibitors of glycosylation (a post-translational modification) on the replication of the single-stranded ribonucleic acid (ssRNA) virus influenza A virus as well as on the transcription and translation of host cell cytokines and their regulators (IFNs and ISGs). In conclusion, we have identified and experimentally validated repurposable anti-SARS-CoV-2 and IAV drugs using a systems biology approach, which may have the potential for treating these viral infections and their complications (sepsis).",medicine
34993277,A Phenomenological Content Analysis of Elder Abuse during COVID-19 Pandemic in India.,Gerontol Geriatr Med,"The entire globe has been fighting the COVID-19 pandemic for the last two years including India. It has resulted in a slew of social problems for the millions of people in society. Elder abuse is one of them. Elder abuse due to COVID-19 pandemic is a matter of grave concern in Indian society. Today, due to COVID-19 pandemic, older people are facing social rejection, mental torture and abusive behaviour by family members, relatives, neighbours and caregivers. The objectives of present study are to examine the nature of elder abuse due to COVID-19 pandemic under the theoretical framework of anomie theory and to explore its outcome on the well-being of older people. The study uses phenomenological content analysis method. The information has been gathered from many Indian newspapers, magazines and news portals. The researchers examined the content of news stories about elder abuse that were published between 1 April 2021 and 15 May, 2021 and analysed the results. The study finds that older people have been abused due to fear of COVID-19 infection, poor financial condition and irresponsibility of caregivers. Most often, elders suffer abuse at the hands of their loved ones, neighbours and caregivers.",medicine

Social support represents an important buffer for family caregivers that allows them to feel less isolated and more positive about their caregiving role. This sequential mixed-methods study aimed to examine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on family caregivers' social connections. Eighty-two caregivers completed a web-based survey which comprised of fixed-choice and open-ended questions. Survey data showed that the majority of caregivers (83%) reported an increase in stress and feeling lonely (77%) during the pandemic. Qualitative interviews with a subsample of caregivers (n=27) further explored social connections during the pandemic. Three themes echoed the quantitative findings and centered around defining boundaries, intentionality in social interactions, and loss of social resources. Although caregivers were often strained by new or increased caregiving demands, many experienced positive changes such as feeling a deeper connection with the care-recipient. Findings from this study highlight the need for further consideration of the impact of social isolation on the well-being of caregivers.",medicine
34732087,Comparison of early postnatal clinical outcomes of newborns born to pregnant women with COVID-19: a case-control study.,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has infected millions of people, including pregnant women and newborns and caused many deaths. Studies examining the effects of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy have mostly focused on maternal outcomes and there are limited data on neonatal outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to compare the early postnatal period clinical outcomes of newborns born to pregnant women with and without COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was used to compare the clinical characteristics of newborns born to pregnant women with and without COVID-19. This study was conducted between 11 March 2020 and 11 March 2021 at Denizli State Hospital, Turkey. This study included 202 newborns selected with a nonprobability method. The clinical records and laboratory results of 202 newborns were reviewed by applying a retrospective questionnaire. Neonatal outcomes were compared between the groups. RESULTS: There were 101 newborns born to pregnant women with COVID-19 in the case group and 101 without COVID-19 in the control group in the study. A considerably higher rate of newborns born to pregnant women with COVID-19 had cesarean delivery (79.2 versus 35.6%, p < .001), premature birth (28.7 versus 10.9%, p = .001), low birth weight (15.8 versus 6.9%, p = .046), neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (37.6 versus 19.8%, p = .005), oxygen need (19.8 versus 37.6, p = .005), and neonatal intensive care unit admission (10.9 versus 37.6%, p = .001). Breastfeeding (1.0 versus 67.3%, p < .001) and nutrition with breast milk rates (33.7 versus 80.2%, p < .001) of newborns born to pregnant women with COVID-19 were significantly lower. The results of 101 newborns who received nasopharyngeal swab samples for COVID-19 were negative. CONCLUSION: Newborns born to pregnant women with COVID-19 were more likely to experience preterm birth, cesarean delivery, low birth weight, neonatal RDS, oxygen demand, need for intensive care, and breastfeeding problems. There was no vertical contamination according to the nasopharyngeal swab samples of the newborns.",medicine
34731830,Impact of work routines on parents' and children's sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.,Sleep Med,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of parental sleep and work arrangements on children's sleep duration during the national lockdown period, referred to as 'Circuit Breaker' (CB), due to COVID-19. METHODS: Cross-sectional, anonymous, online questionnaire to parents with school-going children aged between 3 and 16 years. Child and parental sleep duration in relation to change in parental work arrangements, housing type and number of individuals in the household as reported by parents were evaluated. Descriptive statistics and tests of comparison were used to evaluate data. RESULTS: School-going children (n = 593) had a mean age of 8.68 (SD = 3.65; median 7) years. Both, fathers and mothers had gains in sleep during CB (based on self-reported sleep data), compared to pre-CB. Change in both maternal and paternal sleep duration positively correlated with change in child sleep duration (based on parent-reported sleep data) among all children (r(2) = 0.27, p < 0.001 and r(2) = 0.17, p < 0.001 respectively); pre-schoolers mirrored their mothers' sleep more closely. Parents who changed to working from home during the CB (compared to working from outside home previously) had the greatest gains in sleep during this period. Housing type was not significantly associated with change in child sleep duration from pre-CB to CB. CONCLUSIONS: Greater gains in sleep in parents was associated with working from home during CB. Child sleep duration mirrored gains in parental sleep, especially in pre-school and primary-school-going children. Optimising parental sleep may therefore be one of the means to improve child sleep.",medicine
34731828,Pre-sleep arousal and sleep quality during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy.,Sleep Med,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has strongly affected daily habits and psychological wellbeing, and many studies point to large modifications in several sleep and sleep-related domains. Nevertheless, pre-sleep arousal during the pandemic has been substantially overlooked. Since hyperarousal represents one of the main factors for the development and the perpetuation of chronic insomnia disorder, the assessment of variables associated with high levels of pre-sleep arousal during the pandemic is clinically relevant. The study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of perceived sleep quality and pre-sleep arousal in an Italian sample during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: We used an online survey to collect self-reported sociodemographic, environmental, clinical, sleep, and sleep-related data. Our final sample included 761 participants. RESULTS: Beyond a high frequency of poor sleep quality, depressive and stress symptoms, our results show that almost half of the sample suffered from clinically relevant levels of at least one component (ie, cognitive, somatic) of pre-sleep arousal. Subjects with greater pre-sleep arousal exhibited poorer sleep quality. Also, sleep quality was strongly associated with somatic and cognitive pre-sleep arousal. Regarding the predictors of sleep and sleep-related measures, depressive and event-related stress symptoms were the main factors associated with both poor sleep quality and pre-sleep arousal components. Moreover, specific sociodemographic and environmental variables were uniquely related to sleep quality, cognitive or somatic pre-sleep arousal. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the assessment of specific sleep-related factors (ie, pre-sleep arousal), together with more global measures of sleep quality, may be crucial to depict the complex impact of the pandemic on sleep, and to help prevent and counteract the spread of insomnia symptoms.",medicine
34731270,[Technology-enhanced learning in anesthesiology and emergency medicine : A new approach to medical school teaching in the wake of the pandemic].,Anaesthesist,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought about unprecedented challenges to medical schools. Physical distancing as the most effective means of infection prevention renders traditional classroom teaching nearly impossible and new teaching methods are required to contain the infection risk whilst ensuring high-level education. OBJECTIVE: In order to minimize the need for classroom teaching we have created an interactive multimedia eLearning environment using the open-source learning management system ""Moodle"". This article describes the development of the eLearning environment and aims to establish the acceptance of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) among medical students and the evaluation of TEL as an alternative to classroom teaching. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have built a multimedia eLearning environment for fourth year medical students covering the medical school curriculum ""anesthesiology and emergency medicine"", which is based on the recommendations of the German Society for Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI). We have chosen the open-source learning management system ""Moodle"" as a platform. ""Moodle"" is widely used by Anglo-American educational institutions to support and conduct academic and nonacademic teaching. In order to assess the students' experience, we have carried out an anonymized post-course survey consisting of multiple-choice and free-answer questions. RESULTS: Of the 157 participants 85.4% rated the course as ""very good"", 12.1% as ""good"" and 1.9% as ""OK"". Lower ratings were not given, 54.8% rated the course content as ""very relevant"", 43.3% as ""relevant"" and 1.9% as ""neutral"", 94.3% felt that more comparable online courses should be offered. The free-text answers revealed that accessibility and multimedia self-controlled learning were highly valued; however, it was felt that hands-on training cannot be replaced by eLearning. CONCLUSION: Technology Enhanced Learning was highly valued by our students and helped to reduce the need for classroom teaching; however, for teaching practical skills classroom teaching remains indispensable.",medicine
34731151,Prevalence of COVID-19 among blood donors: The Jordan University of Science and Technology experience.,Medicine (Baltimore),"ABSTRACT: The corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, had health and economic results that profoundly affected communities worldwide. Investigating the seroprevalence of SARS-Cov-2 in blood donors is of a significant clinical and scientific value as it adds to knowledge about local herd immunity levels.To study the prevalence of SARS-Cov-2 infection among blood donors at a tertiary referral hospital in the north of Jordan.This is a prospective study that included all blood donors between September 2020 and March 2021. Donors' IgG antibodies were qualitatively immunoassayed to determine the antibody status against SARS-CoV-2. The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 technique was utilized.One thousand samples were tested by total antibody against SARS-CoV-2. The median age was 29 years, 96.7% were males. The seroprevalence was 14.5%, and 80% of the positive participants did not report previous COVID-19 infection. The seroprevalence of COVID-19 antibodies was less among smokers and those with an O blood group and higher among donors with an AB blood group.The prevalence of COVID-19 among healthy young blood donors at a tertiary teaching health facility in the north of Jordan was 14.5%. Smokers and those with an O blood group were less likely to be seropositive, as opposed to donors with an AB blood group.",medicine
34731148,Pain and physical activity changes during the COVID-19 state of emergency among Japanese adults aged 40 years or older: A cross-sectional study.,Medicine (Baltimore),"ABSTRACT: Understanding the relationship between pain and physical activity (PA) levels is beneficial for maintaining good health status. However, the impact of pain on changes in PA during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine whether PA levels pre-, during, and post-COVID-19 state of emergency differ between Japanese adults who had pain after the COVID-19 state of emergency and those who did not.Data were collected from a cross-sectional online survey conducted between October 19 and 28, 2020. The analytic sample consisted of 1967 Japanese adults aged >/=40 years who completed the online survey. Participants completed questionnaires on the presence of pain and duration of PA, defined as the total PA time per week based on activity frequency and time. Participants were asked to report their PA at 3 time points: October 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic), April 2020 (during the COVID-19 state of emergency), and October 2020 (after the COVID-19 state of emergency).Among participants aged >/=60 years who reported pain in October 2020, the total PA time was significantly lower than participants who did not report having pain. Furthermore, the total PA time in April 2020 was significantly lower than that in October 2019; however, no significant difference in total PA time was observed between April and October 2020. Among participants aged 40 to 59 years, no significant differences were observed in total PA times at the 3 time points between those with and without pain. In addition, the total PA time in October 2020 significantly increased compared to that in April 2020, although it significantly decreased in April 2020 compared to October 2019.This study suggests that older adults with pain have lower PA levels after the COVID-19 state of emergency.",medicine
34731146,Early viral versus late antibiotic-associated diarrhea in novel coronavirus infection.,Medicine (Baltimore),"ABSTRACT: Diarrhea is one of the manifestations of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but it also develops as a complication of massive antibiotic therapy in this disease. This study aimed to compare these types of diarrhea.We included patients with COVID-19 in a cohort study and excluded patients with chronic diarrhea, laxative use, and those who died during the first day of hospitalization.There were 89 (9.3%), 161 (16.7%), and 731 (75.7%) patients with early viral, late antibiotic-associated, and without diarrhea, respectively. Late diarrhea lasted longer (6 [4-10] vs 5 [3-7] days, P < .001) and was more severe. Clostridioides difficile was found in 70.5% of tested patients with late diarrhea and in none with early diarrhea. Presence of late diarrhea was associated with an increased risk of death after 20 days of disease (P = .009; hazard ratio = 4.7). Patients with late diarrhea had a longer hospital stay and total disease duration, and a higher proportion of these patients required intensive care unit admission. Oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (odds ratio [OR] = 2.23), oral clarithromycin (OR = 3.79), and glucocorticoids (OR = 4.41) use was a risk factor for the development of late diarrhea, while ceftriaxone use (OR = 0.35) had a protective effect. Before the development of late diarrhea, decrease in C-reactive protein levels and increase in lymphocyte count stopped but the white blood cell and neutrophil count increased. An increase in neutrophils by >0.6 x 109 cells/L predicted the development of late diarrhea in the coming days (sensitivity 82.0%, specificity 70.8%, area under the curve = 0.791 [0.710-0.872]).Diarrhea in COVID-19 is heterogeneous, and different types of diarrhea require different management.",medicine
34731140,Insights on defeating coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak and predicting tourist arrival on the Chinese Hainan Leisure Island during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Medicine (Baltimore),"BACKGROUND: Hainan province is a very popular leisure tourist arriving city in China. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China and rapidly in early 2020, and due to its rapid worldwide spread, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a global emergency. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Hainan province, many businesses and economies were influenced in this unexpected event, especially in tourism. METHODS: This study used 2 classical forecasting methods to predict the number of tourists on Hainan Leisure Island from September to December in the second half of 2020 and to summarize the COVID-19 fighting experience during the pandemic. In addition, the Hainan government implemented epidemic control measures to resume production and work, and promote new tourism measures to acquire superior COVID-19 protection. RESULTS: Winter's method provides a statistical model for predicting the number of visitors to Hainan under normal conditions. The trend analysis method considers the impact of the black swan event, an irregular event, and only uses the data under the influence of the event to predict according to the trend. CONCLUSION: If the impact of the black swan event (COVID-19) continues, the prediction can be made using this method. In addition, the Hainan government has undertaken timely and effective measures against COVID-19 to promote leisure tourism development.",medicine
34731126,Detection and characterization of COVID-19 findings in chest CT: Feasibility and applicability of an AI-based software tool.,Medicine (Baltimore),"ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged institutions' diagnostic processes worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based software tool that automatically evaluates chest computed tomography for findings of suspected COVID-19.Two groups were retrospectively evaluated for COVID-19-associated ground glass opacities of the lungs (group A: real-time polymerase chain reaction positive COVID patients, n = 108; group B: asymptomatic pre-operative group, n = 88). The performance of an AI-based software assessment tool for detection of COVID-associated abnormalities was compared with human evaluation based on COVID-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS) scores performed by 3 readers.All evaluated variables of the AI-based assessment showed significant differences between the 2 groups (P < .01). The inter-reader reliability of CO-RADS scoring was 0.87. The CO-RADS scores were substantially higher in group A (mean 4.28) than group B (mean 1.50). The difference between CO-RADS scoring and AI assessment was statistically significant for all variables but showed good correlation with the clinical context of the CO-RADS score. AI allowed to predict COVID positive cases with an accuracy of 0.94.The evaluated AI-based algorithm detects COVID-19-associated findings with high sensitivity and may support radiologic workflows during the pandemic.",medicine
34731116,Has COVID-19 changed the approach to HIV diagnosis?: A multicentric Italian experience.,Medicine (Baltimore),"ABSTRACT: The occurrence of COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative effect on health care systems over the last year. Health care providers were forced to focus mainly on COVID-19 patients, neglecting in many cases equally important diseases, both acute and chronic. Therefore, also screening and diagnostic strategies for HIV could have been significantly impaired.This retrospective, multicenter, observational study aimed at assessing the number and characteristics of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses during COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and compared characteristics of people living with HIV at diagnosis between pre- and post-COVID-19 era (2019 vs 2020).Our results showed a significant reduction of HIV diagnoses during pandemic. By contrast, people living with HIV during pandemic were older and were diagnosed in earlier stage of disease (considering CD4+ T cell count) compared to those who were diagnosed the year before. Moreover, there was a significant decrease of new HIV diagnoses among men who have sex with men, probably for the impact of social distancing and restriction applied by the Italian Government. Late presentation incidence, if numbers in 2020 were lower than those in 2019, is still an issue.Routinely performing HIV testing in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection is identifying and linking to care underdiagnosed people living with HIV earlier. Thus, combined tests (HIV and SARS-CoV-2) should be implemented in patients with SARS-CoV-2 symptoms overlapping HIV's ones. Lastly, our results lastly showed how urgent implementation of a national policy for HIV screening is necessary.",medicine
34731113,The clinical characters and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with multiple organ dysfunction.,Medicine (Baltimore),"ABSTRACT: To depict the clinical characters and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).A cohort consisted of 526 patients, which including 109 patients complicated MODS, was retrospectively analyzed to examine the clinical characteristics and risk factors of MODS.Among the 526 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia patients, 109 patients developed multiple organ failure, the incidence rate was 20.7%. Among all 109 patients with MODS, 81.7% were over 60 years old, and 63.3% were male. The most common symptoms were fever (79.8%), dyspnea (73.4%), and fatigue (55.0%). Compared with patients non-MODS patients, there were 70 cases of MODS patients with one or more underlying diseases (64.2% vs 41.0%, P < .001). Respiratory failure (92.7%), circulatory failure (52.0%), and liver function injury (30.9%) were the most common symptoms within the spectrum of MODS. Invasive ventilator, noninvasive ventilator, and high-flow respiratory support treatment for patients in MODS patients were higher than those in the non-MODS group (P < .001). The antiviral therapy and 2 or more antibacterial drug treatments in MODS patients were higher than those in the non-MODS group (P < .001). The median hospital stay of all patients was 16 days (interquartile range [IQR], 9-26), of which 20 days (IQR, 11.5-30.5) in the MODS patients, which was approximately 4 days longer than that of non-MODS patients. In addition, our data suggested that lymphocyte counts <1.0 * 109/L, Troponin T > 0.014 ng/mL and lower oxygenation index were risk factors for MODS. In the early stage of hospital admission, higher inflammatory indexes and lactic acid concentration were associated with increased risk of death.MODS often leads to poor prognosis in coronavirus disease 2019. Our data suggested the importance of early identification of MODS. We recommend close monitoring and timely supportive therapy for patients with high risks, stopping the disease progression before it was too late.",medicine

Many medical groups across the United States have experienced extraordinary clinical and financial pressures due to COVID-19 as a result of a decline in elective inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures and most nonurgent elective physician visits. The current study reports how our medical group in a metropolitan community in Kentucky rebooted our ambulatory and inpatient services following the guidance of our state's phased reopening. Particular attention focused on the transition between the initial COVID-19 surge and post-COVID-19 surge and how our medical group responded to meet community needs. Ten strategies were incorporated in our medical group, including heightened communication; ambulatory telehealth; safe and clean outpatient environment; marketing; physician, other medical provider, and staff compensation; high quality patient experience; schedule optimization; rescheduling tactics; data management; and primary care versus specialty approaches. These methods are applicable to both the current rebooting stage as well as to a potential resurgence of COVID-19 in the future.",medicine
34730655,COVID-19 and the medicines regulation challenges in times of pandemic.,Cien Saude Colet,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought challenges related to prevention, protection and care. Coping strategies, such as social distancing, individual protection for the population and workers, increase in the number of intensive care beds, provision of human resources and equipment are necessary actions. However, there are yet no specific effective and safe medicines that justify their use. The challenge imposed on the regulatory framework for medicines is aimed at providing timely access to medicines capable of modifying the course of the disease and leading to better treatment outcomes, with health safety. Regulatory agencies must protect the health by assessing the actual benefits and harms of the medicines under these specific conditions. The article discusses the main regulatory challenges and response of regulatory agencies to the demands imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially, drug development strategies and regulatory strategies related to off-label use. Emergency drug use authorization and alternatives for extended/compassionate use are addressed, as well as clinical trials, safety assessment and monitoring of adverse events.",medicine
34730508,Association of Healthcare Access With Intensive Care Unit Utilization and Mortality in Patients of Hispanic Ethnicity Hospitalized With COVID-19.,J Hosp Med,"BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States experience a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 deaths. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether outcome differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic COVID-19 hospitalized patients exist and, if so, to identify the main malleable contributing factors. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study of 6097 adult COVID-19 patients hospitalized within a single large healthcare system from March to November 2020. EXPOSURES: Self-reported ethnicity and primary language. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) utilization and in-hospital death. We used age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and multivariable analysis to evaluate the associations between ethnicity/language groups and outcomes. RESULTS: 32.1% of patients were Hispanic, 38.6% of whom reported a non-English primary language. Hispanic patients were less likely to be insured, have a primary care provider, and have accessed the healthcare system prior to the COVID-19 admission. After adjusting for age, Hispanic inpatients experienced higher ICU utilization (non-English-speaking: OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.47-2.08; English-speaking: OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.95-1.33) and higher mortality (non-English-speaking: OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.10-1.86; English-speaking: OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.19-1.98) compared to non-Hispanic inpatients. There were no observed treatment disparities among ethnic groups. After adjusting for age, Hispanic inpatients had elevated disease severity at admission (non-English-speaking: OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.89-2.72; English-speaking: OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.10- 1.61). In multivariable analysis, the associations between ethnicity/language and clinical outcomes decreased after considering baseline disease severity (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The associations between ethnicity and clinical outcomes can be explained by elevated disease severity at admission and limited access to healthcare for Hispanic patients, especially non-English-speaking Hispanics.",medicine
34730039,The role of imaging techniques in understanding and evaluating the long-term pulmonary effects of COVID-19.,Expert Rev Respir Med,"INTRODUCTION: Limited data exist regarding the long-term pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19. Identifying features utilizing multiple imaging modalities engenders a clearer picture of the illness's long-term consequences. AREAS COVERED: This review encompasses the common pulmonary findings associated with different imaging modalities during acute and late remission stages of COVID-19 pneumonia. EXPERT OPINION: Chest x-ray, a common preliminary diagnostic imaging technique, is not optimal for extended care due to limited tissue contrast resolution providing suboptimal assessment of pulmonary pathology and subtle interval changes. Ultrasound may be utilized on a case-by-case basis in certain patient populations, or in countries with limited resources. Chest CT's accessibility, high tissue contrast and spatial resolution make it the foremost modality for long-term COVID-19 follow-up. While MRI can viably monitor extrapulmonary disease due to its lack of radiation and high inherent soft-tissue contrast, it has limited pulmonary utility due to motion artifact and alveolar gas decreasing lung signal. Although 18F-FDG-PET/CT is costly and has limited specificity, it can provide molecular level data and inflammation quantification. Lung perfusion scintigraphy may also explain COVID-19 induced thromboembolic events and persistent dyspnea despite normal structural imaging and testing results. Correlating the long-term pulmonary findings of COVID-19 with each imaging modality is essential in elucidating the post-recovery course.",medicine
34729697,"Women, Younger Clinicians', and Caregivers' Experiences of Burnout and Well-being During COVID-19 in a US Healthcare System.",J Gen Intern Med,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic brought rapid changes to the work and personal lives of clinicians. OBJECTIVE: To assess clinician burnout and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and guide healthcare system improvement efforts. DESIGN: A survey asking about clinician burnout, well-being, and work experiences. PARTICIPANTS: Surveys distributed to 8141 clinicians from June to August 2020 in 9 medical groups and 17 hospitals at Sutter Health, a large healthcare system in Northern California. MAIN MEASURES: Burnout was the primary outcome, and other indicators of well-being and work experience were also measured. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. All statistical inferences were based on weighted estimates adjusting for response bias. KEY RESULTS: A total of 3176 clinicians (39.0%) responded to the survey. Weighted results showed 29.2% reported burnout, and burnout was more common among women than among men (39.0% vs. 22.7%, p<0.01). In multivariate models, being a woman was associated with increased odds of reporting burnout (OR=2.19, 95% CI: 1.51-3.17) and being 55+ years old with lower odds (OR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.87). More women than men reported that childcare/caregiving was impacting work (32.9% vs. 19.0%, p<0.01). Even after controlling for age and gender, clinicians who reported childcare/caregiving responsibilities impacted their work had substantially higher odds of reporting burnout (OR=2.19, 95% CI: 1.54-3.11). Other factors associated with higher burnout included worrying about safety at work, being given additional work tasks, concern about losing one's job, and working in emergency medicine or radiology. Protective factors included believing one's concerns will be acted upon and feeling highly valued. CONCLUSIONS: This large survey found the pandemic disproportionally impacted women, younger clinicians, and those whose caregiving responsibilities impacted their work. These results highlight the need for a holistic and targeted strategy for improving clinician well-being that addresses the needs of women, younger clinicians, and those with caregiving responsibilities.",medicine
34729600,Potential risk factors associated with COVID-19 in health care workers.,Occup Med (Lond),"BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCWs) have been recognized as being at higher risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection; however, relevant factors and magnitude have not been clearly elucidated. AIM: This study was aimed to describe COVID-19 infections among hospital employees at a large tertiary care hospital located in Ontario, Canada from March to July 2020, towards better understanding potential risk factors. METHODS: Data on all HCWs with either a positive COVID test or a high-risk exposure from March to July 2020 were analyzed. HCWs with positive COVID test results and high-risk exposures were described. Those who developed COVID-19 following high-risk exposure were compared to those who did not. Data were also analyzed to determine trends over time. RESULTS: Over the period of observation, 193 staff (2% of total working staff) had a positive COVID-19 test. Incidence of HCW infections closely followed community incidence. Overall, 31% of COVID-19 cases were deemed occupationally acquired. Of these, 41% were acquired from a patient, with the remainder (59%) from fellow staff. Over the same period, 204 staff were identified as having a high-risk exposure. The majority of exposures (55%) were patient-associated, with the remaining (45%) resulting from staff-to-staff contact. Overall, 13% went on to develop COVID-19. Of these cases, 58% were patient-associated and 42% were a result of staff-to-staff transmission. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs are at risk for work-related COVID-19. Given the number of infections attributed to staff-staff transmission, greater attention could be paid to implementing prevention measures in non-clinical areas.",medicine

However, the pharmacological mechanisms underlying this success remain unclear. Hence, the aim of this review is to combine pharmacological assays based on the theory of TCM in order to elucidate the potential signaling pathways, targets, active compounds, and formulas of herbs that are involved in the TCM treatment of COVID-19, which exhibits combatting viral infections, immune regulation, and amelioration of lung injury and fibrosis. Extensive reports on target screening are elucidated using virtual prediction via docking analysis or network pharmacology based on existing data. The results of these reports indicate that an intricate regulatory mechanism is involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Therefore, more pharmacological research on the natural herbs used in TCM should be conducted in order to determine the association between TCM and COVID-19 and account for the observed therapeutic effects of TCM against COVID-19.",medicine

Due to unavailable specific drugs for this virus, there is an urgent need for supportive cares. Epigenetic immune boosting approaches and developing anti-inflammatory agents by gut-associated bioactive macronutrients can be plausible protective cares for COVID-19. Suitable intake of bioactive macronutrients including prebiotics, fatty acids, proteins and branched-chain amino acids may result in anti-viral responses through modulating macrophages and dendritic cells via Toll-like receptors, decreasing viral load, inactivating the enveloped viruses, increasing the anti-inflammatory metabolites and inhibiting the proliferation of microbial organisms. Bioactive macronutrients may help in promotion of immunological responses and recovery acceleration against Covid-19. This review focuses on the mechanisms of bioactive macronutrients and related clinical trials on enveloped viruses with emphasis on gut-microbiome-immune axis.

BNT162b2 effectiveness against any, symptomatic or asymptomatic, Delta infection was 45.3% (95% CI, 22.0-61.6%) >/=14 d after the first vaccine dose, but only 51.9% (95% CI, 47.0-56.4%) >/=14 d after the second dose, with 50% of fully vaccinated individuals receiving their second dose before 11 May 2021. Corresponding mRNA-1273 effectiveness >/=14 d after the first or second dose was 73.7% (95% CI, 58.1-83.5%) and 73.1% (95% CI, 67.5-77.8%), respectively. Notably, effectiveness against Delta-induced severe, critical or fatal disease was 93.4% (95% CI, 85.4-97.0%) for BNT162b2 and 96.1% (95% CI, 71.6-99.5%) for mRNA-1273 >/= 14 d after the second dose.

34728830,Viral loads of Delta-variant SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections after vaccination and booster with BNT162b2.,Nat Med,"The effectiveness of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing disease and reducing viral loads of breakthrough infections (BTIs) has been decreasing, concomitantly with the rise of the Delta variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, it is unclear whether the observed decreased effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing viral loads is inherent to the Delta variant or is dependent on time from immunization. By analyzing viral loads of over 16,000 infections during the current, Delta-variant-dominated pandemic wave in Israel, we found that BTIs in recently fully vaccinated individuals have lower viral loads than infections in unvaccinated individuals. However, this effect starts to decline 2 months after vaccination and ultimately vanishes 6 months or longer after vaccination. Notably, we found that the effect of BNT162b2 on reducing BTI viral loads is restored after a booster dose. These results suggest that BNT162b2 might decrease the infectiousness of BTIs even with the Delta variant, and that, although this protective effect declines with time, it can be restored, at least temporarily, with a third, booster, vaccine dose.",medicine

34728081,Falling through the cracks: Evaluating the role of nonacute surgical liaison personnel during COVID-19-A narrative review.,Surgery,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the New Zealand government instituted a 4-level alert system, which resulted in the rapid dissolution of nonurgent surgical services to minimize occupational exposure to both patients and staff, with the primary health sector bearing most of the diverted caseload. Consequently, the study authors sought to collate information around the establishment of a supportive nonacute surgical liaison role in a public hospital surgical department, with an interest in establishing this role in New Zealand. METHODS: The narrative review conducted systematically in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Databases searched included Pubmed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials. A deductive analysis was applied using a demand management model developed by the Institute for Innovation and Improvement at Waitemata District Health Board. All included studies were rated using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence tool. RESULTS: Collation of 19 studies resulted in 3 key findings: first, that a surgical liaison could be utilized at the primary care to specialist interface to improve communication and workflow between services. Second, a liaison could be utilized directly communicating with patients as a means of increasing engagement and self-management. Finally, this service can be offered through multiple modalities including a noncontact telehealth service. CONCLUSION: Evidence of nonacute surgical liaisons both internationally and specifically within New Zealand has been collated to provide evidence for its application.",medicine

34727904,Medical students in Russia evaluate the training during the COVID-19 pandemic: a student survey.,BMC Med Educ,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to obtain feedback from medical students in Russia regarding their e-learning experience during COVID-19 Pandemic. METHODS: Thirteen thousand forty students from 46 Medical Schools in Russia completed an original evaluation form validated by 6 experts. Criterion and construct validity were determined in a pilot study (n = 46). The study design was based on the use of Google Forms. Participants used the Visual Analog Scale from 1 to 10 to assess the level of knowledge acquired. RESULTS: 95.31% of medical schools in Russia switched to e-learning during the Pandemic. 39.8% of the students stated that the time to prepare for the class has doubled. For 19.9% of them, it increased by one third, while 26.6% did not report any changes. 38,4% of the participants are satisfied with particular elements of e-learning, 27.5% like such a format, 22.9% do not like it, and 11.2% could not answer the question. The average scores for the knowledge assessment were 5.9 for the humanities, 6.1 for fundamental science, and 6.0 for clinical training. CONCLUSIONS: The most important findings are increased self-instruction time, insufficient knowledge gained and territorial and socio-economic inequalities within the country. Meanwhile, most students favor distance learning or its particular elements. Consequently, medical education leaders in Russia should consider the implementation of blended training in medicine taking into account specific regional factors, ensuring its effectiveness at all stages.",medicine

RESULTS: The average age of participants was 20.51 +/- 1.88 years. 57.1% of the college students were male. In total, 25.9% of college students reported depression symptoms. ST > 4 h/day was positively correlated with depressive symptoms (beta = 0.48, 95%CI 0.37-0.59). COVID-19ST > 1 h/day was positively correlated with depressive symptoms (beta = 0.54, 95%CI 0.43-0.65), compared with COVID-19ST </= 0.5 h/day. Compared with PA >/= 3 day/week, PA < 3 day/week was positively associated with depression symptoms (beta = 0.01, 95%CI 0.008-0.012). Compared with low ST and high PA, there was an interaction association between high ST and low PA on depression (beta = 0.31, 95%CI 0.26-0.36). Compared with low COVID-19ST and high PA, there was an interaction association between high COVID-19ST and low PA on depression (beta = 0.37, 95%CI 0.32-0.43). There were also current residence areas differences. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identified that high ST or low PA was positively associated with depressive symptoms independently, and there was also an interactive effect between ST and PA on depressive symptoms.",medicine
34727801,SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in healthcare workers in a high-volume ophthalmology centre in Guatemala.,Ann Med,"PURPOSE: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in eye healthcare workers (EHCW) in the largest ophthalmology centre in Guatemala and factors associated with antibody positivity. METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional sero-survey in all the staff at the largest ophthalmology centre in Guatemala. Serum samples were collected and tested for total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 employing Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassay. Results were reported as reactive or non-reactive. According to patient exposure the staff were divided into low risk (technicians, domestic and administrative staff) and high risk (nurses, ophthalmologists, anaesthesiologists, and optometrists). Among those with positive antibodies, they were given a survey that included demographic characteristics, COVID-19 exposure, and related symptomatology. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with antibody positivity. RESULTS: On November 25th a total of 94 healthcare workers were sero-surveyed, mean age was 34.15 years (+/-8.41), most (57.44%) were females. Seroprevalence was 18%, the majority (77%) were in the low-risk group; while 64% at high-risk, tested negative. Those at low exposure, were five times more likely to have antibodies than those at high exposure (OR:5.69; 95% CI 1.69-19.13). Age and gender were not associated to seropositivity. CONCLUSIONS: We found a similar seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in EHCW to what has been reported in other healthcare groups. Seropositivity was higher among HCW with fewer patient exposure, hence the probability of community transmission.Key messagesEven though eye healthcare workers are believed to be at higher risk of infection, the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in this group is comparable to what has been reported previously in other healthcare groups.",medicine
34727669,A comparative study of the psychological impacts of tasks related and unrelated to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on nurses.,Yeungnam Univ J Med,"Background: This study assessed the psychological impact of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on university hospital nurses. It provides an assessment of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, distress, and burnout of nurses dealing directly and indirectly with COVID-19. Methods: In a web-based, cross-sectional study, 111 nurses from Daegu Catholic University Hospital in Korea were enrolled from August 4 to August 9, 2020. Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Maslach Burnout Inventory were used to assess the psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and burnout among the study participants. Results: Of 111 nurses, 35 (31.5%), nine (8.1%), 26 (23.4%), and 49 (44.1%) experienced depression, anxiety, distress, and burnout, respectively. Nurses who performed COVID-19-related tasks were more likely to have moderate depression (related vs. unrelated, 52.0% vs. 25.6%; p=0.037). There were no differences in anxiety, distress, and burnout between nurses with and without COVID-19-related tasks. More than 50% of the participants showed receptive and positive attitudes toward caring for COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Nurses who performed COVID-19-related tasks had a higher risk of depression. There were no significant differences in anxiety, distress, and burnout between the two groups. Since nurses who perform COVID-19-related tasks are more prone to psychological distress, continued psychiatric interventions are required for infectious disease outbreaks with a high mortality rate for healthcare workers who are emotionally vulnerable.",medicine
34726987,"Clinical, Prognostic, and Predictive Value of Olfactory Dysfunction for COVID-19: A Prospective Controlled Study.",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of olfactory dysfunction on the course and severity of COVID-19 and its prognostic and predictive significance for COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. SETTING: Ondokuz Mayis University School of Medicine. METHODS: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive patients, patients with COVID-19-related symptoms who had a negative PCR result, and healthy controls were included in the study. Clinicodemographic characteristics, inflammatory markers, and computed tomography stages were recorded. Disease progression and intensive care unit admission were registered. The visual analog scale (0, worst; 10, best) was used to evaluate subjective olfactory, taste, and nasal breathing ability, and the Sniffin' Sticks identification (SS-ID) test was used for psychophysical olfactory assessment. RESULTS: Mean SS-ID scores were significantly lower in the positive group (8.77) than in the negative (10.43) and healthy control (12.17) groups. VAS-smell scores were significantly lower and anosmia was more prevalent in PCR-positive patients (P < .01). SS-ID and VAS-smell scores were significantly correlated (r = 0.681, P < .001). The inflammatory parameters, pulmonary infiltration stage, disease progression, and ICU admission were not associated with SS-ID scores. A cutoff SS-ID score <9 resulted in 55.56% sensitivity in predicting COVID-19 positivity, and a cutoff VAS-smell score <8 yielded 72.22% sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Olfactory dysfunction was detected objectively and subjectively in the PCR-positive group, and no difference was found in terms of taste function and nasal breathing. The severity and prognosis of COVID-19 are not exclusively dependent on olfactory dysfunction. The degree of olfactory dysfunction can be useful in predicting PCR positivity.",medicine

34726929,Undertaking Research Using Online Nominal Group Technique: Lessons from an International Study (RESPACC).,J Palliat Med,"Background: Nominal group technique (NGT) is a well-established research method for establishing consensus. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, research methods need to be adapted to engage with participants online. Objective: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of adapting NGT to an online format. Setting: Palliative care clinicians (n = 31) in Greece, Romania, and Spain. Methods: NGT discussions were used to elicit palliative care clinicians' opinions, and to rank priorities regarding their understanding and needs about clinical research. Preliminary online training of country-based facilitators was followed by content analysis of debriefing reports to capture learning related to the online NGT format. Results/Implementation: Three NGT sessions used online platforms (Zoom/MS Office/Mentimeter) for the meetings. Analysis of the facilitator reports generated three themes: preparation/facilitation/timing; optimizing technology; and interactions. Conclusions: Conducting NGT meetings online is viable and may be advantageous when compared with traditional face-to-face meetings, but requires careful preparation for participants to contribute effectively.",medicine
34726149,Risk for depression tripled during the COVID-19 pandemic in emerging adults followed for the last 8 years.,Psychol Med,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly increased depression rates, particularly in emerging adults. The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal changes in depression risk before and during COVID-19 in a cohort of emerging adults in the U.S. and to determine whether prior drinking or sleep habits could predict the severity of depressive symptoms during the pandemic. METHODS: Participants were 525 emerging adults from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), a five-site community sample including moderate-to-heavy drinkers. Poisson mixed-effect models evaluated changes in the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) from before to during COVID-19, also testing for sex and age interactions. Additional analyses examined whether alcohol use frequency or sleep duration measured in the last pre-COVID assessment predicted pandemic-related increase in depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The prevalence of risk for clinical depression tripled due to a substantial and sustained increase in depressive symptoms during COVID-19 relative to pre-COVID years. Effects were strongest for younger women. Frequent alcohol use and short sleep duration during the closest pre-COVID visit predicted a greater increase in COVID-19 depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The sharp increase in depression risk among emerging adults heralds a public health crisis with alarming implications for their social and emotional functioning as this generation matures. In addition to the heightened risk for younger women, the role of alcohol use and sleep behavior should be tracked through preventive care aiming to mitigate this looming mental health crisis.",medicine
34726136,"Mental health in relation to changes in sleep, exercise, alcohol and diet during the COVID-19 pandemic: examination of four UK cohort studies.",Psychol Med,"BACKGROUND: Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have included lockdowns and social distancing with considerable disruptions to people's lives. These changes may have particularly impacted on those with mental health problems, leading to a worsening of inequalities in the behaviours which influence health. METHODS: We used data from four national longitudinal British cohort studies (N = 10 666). Respondents reported mental health (psychological distress and anxiety/depression symptoms) and health behaviours (alcohol, diet, physical activity and sleep) before and during the pandemic. Associations between pre-pandemic mental ill-health and pandemic mental ill-health and health behaviours were examined using logistic regression; pooled effects were estimated using meta-analysis. RESULTS: Worse mental health was related to adverse health behaviours; effect sizes were largest for sleep, exercise and diet, and weaker for alcohol. The associations between poor mental health and adverse health behaviours were larger during the May lockdown than pre-pandemic. In September, when restrictions had eased, inequalities had largely reverted to pre-pandemic levels. A notable exception was for sleep, where differences by mental health status remained high. Risk differences for adverse sleep for those with the highest level of prior mental ill-health compared to those with the lowest were 21.2% (95% CI 16.2-26.2) before lockdown, 25.5% (20.0-30.3) in May and 28.2% (21.2-35.2) in September. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings suggest that mental health is an increasingly important factor in health behaviour inequality in the COVID era. The promotion of mental health may thus be an important component of improving post-COVID population health.",medicine
34726085,What are the recommendations for returning athletes who have experienced long term COVID-19 symptoms?,Ann Med,"Currently, there is limited research reporting the symptoms of long COVID among athletes, and the recommendations for athletes returning to competition/training who have experienced long COVID symptoms. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to synthesise the recommendations for returning athletes who have experienced long COVID symptoms. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO under CRD42021265939. Two authors searched the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus from August 2019-July 2021. Search terms included words related to ""long COVID"", ""athlete"" and ""return"". Data extraction was completed for each study by two independent investigators for: (1) first author name; (2) year of publication; (3) journal; (4) Definition of athlete (i.e. elite or non-elite) (5) Recommendations reported. A total of 220 records were found. Following title and abstract screening, 61 studies were eligible for full text screening. Overall, no studies, commentaries, editorials or reviews provided specific recommendations for ""long COVID"" defined as COVID-19 signs and symptoms lasting for over 4 weeks as a result of COVID-19 infection. In addition, we found no studies which reported symptoms of athletes suffering from long COVID. Despite the lack of evidence, we did find eight separate professional recommendations for managing ""long-term effects"" and ""ongoing"" or ""prolonged"" symptoms and COVID-19 complications among athletes. Practitioners should be aware of both mental and physical symptoms of long COVID, and additional considerations may be required for athletes who have undergone intensive care. The present review provides a list of recommendations based on existing literature that may be followed and implemented for returning athletes.Key MessagesFurther research, including longitudinal research of athletes who have tested positive for COVID-19, is required to develop evidenced-based guidelines for athletes with ongoing COVID-19 symptoms.Prior to returning to play after COVID-19 infection, a thorough medical history, physical and psychological examination should be conducted by a medical professional.Athletes should continue to monitor and record their own physical and psychological markers of health.",medicine
34725907,Humoral immune response following prime and boost BNT162b2 vaccination in people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy.,HIV Med,"OBJECTIVES: People living with HIV (PLWH) with low CD4 T-cell counts may be at a higher risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes and in need of efficient vaccination. The World Health Organization (WHO) now recommends prioritizing PLHIV for COVID-19 vaccination. Data on immune responses after messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination in PLHIV in relation to CD4 counts are scarce. We aimed at assessing the humoral immune response in PLHIV after mRNA vaccination against COVID-19. METHODS: We examined a cohort of PLHIV after prime (n = 88) and boost (n = 52) vaccination with BNT162b2. We assessed levels of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG)/IgA and circulating neutralizing antibodies in plasma and correlated results to the cellular immune status. BNT162b2-vaccinated health care workers served as controls. RESULTS: All PLWH had a viral load of </= 200 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL and 96.5% had a viral load of < 50 copies/mL. Anti-S IgG and neutralizing antibody responses after BNT162b2 priming were significantly lower in PLHIV having a CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio of < 0.5. However, we observed robust humoral immunity in the majority of PLWH receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) irrespective of CD4 T-cell nadir, current CD4 count or CD4:CD8 ratio after full BNT162b2 vaccination. Nevertheless, HIV-negative controls produced significantly higher mean anti-S IgG concentrations with less variability. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of PLWH mounted robust responses after complete BNT162b2 vaccination but overall amounts of antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain were variable. The impact on clinical efficacy remains unclear.",medicine

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: This study is based on the Medicrime Convention, empirical and analytical data of the WHO, Interpol, Europol, NABF, Directive 2011/62/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 8, 2011, the regulatory acts and juridical practice of Ukraine, experts interview of pharmacy practicians, analysis of websites. Totally 18 laws and papers, 34 court judgments, 50 websites were analyzed, six experts were interviewed. Dialectical, comparative, analytic, synthetic, system analyses and sociological research methods were used. RESULTS: Results: Illegal Internet pharmacies are widespread in Europe, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This black market poses a severe threat to patient safety and public health as falsifying, substandard, and smuggled medicines are sold through these channels. Without any exception, all illegal pharmacies sell prescription drugs without any prescriptions. Regulatory and protective legal instruments at the national and international levels are insufficient to counter the Internet trade in medicines. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The widespread proliferation of illegal Internet pharmacies in Europe requires European states to work together to protect patient safety and public health. A legal mechanism needs to be established to exchange information and combat illegal pharmaceutical activities on the Internet at the international level. At the national level, it is necessary to strengthen control over the wholesale of prescription medications to prevent them from entering the black market.",medicine
34725052,Prevalence and clinical implications of persistent or exertional cardiopulmonary symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection in 3597 collegiate athletes: a study from the Outcomes Registry for Cardiac Conditions in Athletes (ORCCA).,Br J Sports Med,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and clinical implications of persistent or exertional cardiopulmonary symptoms in young competitive athletes following SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This observational cohort study from the Outcomes Registry for Cardiac Conditions in Athletes included 3597 US collegiate athletes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical characteristics, advanced diagnostic testing and SARS-CoV-2-associated sequelae were compared between athletes with persistent symptoms >3 weeks, exertional symptoms on return to exercise and those without persistent or exertional symptoms. RESULTS: Among 3597 athletes (mean age 20 years (SD, 1 year), 34% female), data on persistent and exertional symptoms were reported in 3529 and 3393 athletes, respectively. Persistent symptoms >3 weeks were present in 44/3529 (1.2%) athletes with 2/3529 (0.06%) reporting symptoms >12 weeks. Exertional cardiopulmonary symptoms were present in 137/3393 (4.0%) athletes. Clinical evaluation and diagnostic testing led to the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-associated sequelae in 12/137 (8.8%) athletes with exertional symptoms (five cardiac involvement, two pneumonia, two inappropriate sinus tachycardia, two postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and one pleural effusion). No SARS-CoV-2-associated sequelae were identified in athletes with isolated persistent symptoms. Of athletes with chest pain on return to exercise who underwent cardiac MRI (CMR), 5/24 (20.8%) had probable or definite cardiac involvement. In contrast, no athlete with exertional symptoms without chest pain who underwent CMR (0/20) was diagnosed with probable or definite SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement. CONCLUSION: Collegiate athletes with SARS-CoV-2 infection have a low prevalence of persistent or exertional symptoms on return to exercise. Exertional cardiopulmonary symptoms, specifically chest pain, warrant a comprehensive evaluation.",medicine

34723828,Discussion of Weight Loss Surgery in Instagram Posts: Successive Sampling Study.,JMIR Perioper Med,"BACKGROUND: The majority of American adults search for health and illness information on the internet. However, the quality and accuracy of this information are notoriously variable. With the advent of social media, US individuals have increasingly shared their own health and illness experiences, including those related to bariatric surgery, on social media platforms. Previous research has found that peer-to-peer requesting and giving of advice related to bariatric surgery on social media is common, that such advice is often presented in stark terms, and that the advice may not reflect patient standards of care. These previous investigations have helped to map bariatric surgery content on Facebook and YouTube. OBJECTIVE: This objective of this study was to document and compare weight loss surgery (WLS)-related content on Instagram in the months leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic and 1 year later. METHODS: We analyzed a total of 300 Instagram posts (50 posts per week for 3 consecutive weeks in late February and early March in both 2020 and 2021) uploaded using the hashtag #wls. Descriptive statistics were reported, and independent 1-tailed chi-square tests were used to determine if a post's publication year statistically affected its inclusion of a particular type of content. RESULTS: Overall, advice giving and personal responsibility for outcomes were emphasized by WLS posters on Instagram. However, social support was less emphasized. The safety, challenges, and risks associated with WLS were rarely discussed. The majority of posts did not contain references to facts from reputable medical sources. Posts published in 2021 were more likely to mention stress/hardships of living with WLS (45/150, 30%, vs 29/150, 19.3%; P=.03); however, those published in 2020 more often identified the importance of ongoing support for WLS success (35/150, 23.3%, vs 16/150, 10.7%; P=.004). CONCLUSIONS: Given that bariatric patients have low rates of postoperative follow-up, yet post-operative care and yet support are associated with improved health and weight loss outcomes, and given that health content on the web is of mixed accuracy, bariatric professionals may wish to consider including an online support forum moderated by a professional as a routine part of postoperative care. Doing so may not only improve follow-up rates but may offer providers the opportunity to counter inaccuracies encountered on social media.",medicine
34723680,Vaccinating adolescents against SARS-CoV-2 in England: a risk-benefit analysis.,J R Soc Med,"OBJECTIVE: To offer a quantitative risk-benefit analysis of two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among adolescents in England. SETTING: England. DESIGN: Following the risk-benefit analysis methodology carried out by the US Centers for Disease Control, we calculated historical rates of hospital admission, Intensive Care Unit admission and death for ascertained SARS-CoV-2 cases in children aged 12-17 in England. We then used these rates alongside a range of estimates for incidence of long COVID, vaccine efficacy and vaccine-induced myocarditis, to estimate hospital and Intensive Care Unit admissions, deaths and cases of long COVID over a period of 16 weeks under assumptions of high and low case incidence. PARTICIPANTS: All 12-17 year olds with a record of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in England between 1 July 2020 and 31 March 2021 using national linked electronic health records, accessed through the British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalisations, Intensive Care Unit admissions, deaths and cases of long COVID averted by vaccinating all 12-17 year olds in England over a 16-week period under different estimates of future case incidence. RESULTS: At high future case incidence of 1000/100,000 population/week over 16 weeks, vaccination could avert 4430 hospital admissions and 36 deaths over 16 weeks. At the low incidence of 50/100,000/week, vaccination could avert 70 hospital admissions and two deaths over 16 weeks. The benefit of vaccination in terms of hospitalisations in adolescents outweighs risks unless case rates are sustainably very low (below 30/100,000 teenagers/week). Benefit of vaccination exists at any case rate for the outcomes of death and long COVID, since neither have been associated with vaccination to date. CONCLUSIONS: Given the current (as at 15 September 2021) high case rates (680/100,000 population/week in 10-19 year olds) in England, our findings support vaccination of adolescents against SARS-CoV2.",medicine
34723662,Peer assessment after clinical exposure (PACE): an evaluation of structured peer support for staff in emergency care.,Br J Nurs,"BACKGROUND: There is an increasing body of evidence that identifies psychological stressors associated with working in emergency medicine. Peer Assessment After Clinical Exposure (PACE) is a structured programme designed to support staff following traumatic or chronic work-related stressful exposure. The first author of this study created the PACE programme and implemented it in one emergency department (ED). AIM: A service evaluation designed to explore the thoughts and experiences of the staff who accessed the PACE support service. METHOD: Participants were selected by a non-probability convenience strategy to represent the ED staff population. The study cohort ranged from junior staff nurse level to emergency consultant. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview and examined by the method of interpretative phenomenological analysis. FINDINGS: This study confirmed the findings of previous research that current pressures within the ED include crowding, time pressure and working within an uncontrollable environment. Eight participants identified an absence of previous emotional support resulting in dissociation and avoidance behaviours following traumatic exposure. Overall, the PACE service was well received by the majority of staff (11/12). There was a positive association with the one-to-one element and the educational component helped to reduce the stigma associated with stress reactions after work-related exposure. CONCLUSION: PACE received a positive response from staff. This service presently does not exist elsewhere in the NHS so further research will be needed to evaluate its long-term impact and effectiveness on a wider scale.",medicine
34723226,The systemic inflammatory landscape of COVID-19 in pregnancy: Extensive serum proteomic profiling of mother-infant dyads with in utero SARS-CoV-2.,Cell Rep Med,"While pregnancy increases the risk for severe COVID-19, the clinical and immunological implications of COVID-19 on maternal-fetal health remain unknown. Here, we present the clinical and immunological landscapes of 93 COVID-19 mothers and 45 of their SARS-CoV-2-exposed infants through comprehensive serum proteomics profiling for >1,400 cytokines of their peripheral and cord blood specimens. Prenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers NF-kappaB-dependent proinflammatory immune activation. Pregnant women with severe COVID-19 show increased inflammation and unique IFN-lambda antiviral signaling, with elevated levels of IFNL1 and IFNLR1. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection re-shapes maternal immunity at delivery, altering the expression of pregnancy complication-associated cytokines, inducing MMP7, MDK, and ESM1 and reducing BGN and CD209. Finally, COVID-19-exposed infants exhibit induction of T cell-associated cytokines (IL33, NFATC3, and CCL21), while some undergo IL-1beta/IL-18/CASP1 axis-driven neonatal respiratory distress despite birth at term. Our findings demonstrate COVID-19-induced immune rewiring in both mothers and neonates, warranting long-term clinical follow-up to mitigate potential health risks.",medicine
34723225,Weekly SARS-CoV-2 screening of asymptomatic kindergarten to grade 12 students and staff helps inform strategies for safer in-person learning.,Cell Rep Med,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission in K-12 schools was rare during in 2020-2021; few studies included Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended screening of asymptomatic individuals. We conduct a prospective observational study of SARS-CoV-2 screening in a mid-sized suburban public school district to evaluate the incidence of asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), document frequency of in-school transmission, and characterize barriers and facilitators to asymptomatic screening in schools. Staff and students undergo weekly pooled testing using home-collected saliva samples. Identification of >1 case in a school prompts investigation for in-school transmission and enhancement of safety strategies. With layered mitigation measures, in-school transmission even before student or staff vaccination is rare. Screening identifies a single cluster with in-school staff-to-staff transmission, informing decisions about in-person learning. The proportion of survey respondents self-reporting comfort with in-person learning before versus after implementation of screening increases. Costs exceed $260,000 for assays alone; staff and volunteers spend 135-145 h per week implementing screening.",medicine
34723224,Beta RBD boost broadens antibody-mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants in animal models.,Cell Rep Med,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) with resistance to neutralizing antibodies are threatening to undermine vaccine efficacy. Vaccination and infection have led to widespread humoral immunity against the pandemic founder (Wu-Hu-1). Against this background, it is critical to assess the outcomes of subsequent immunization with variant antigens. It is not yet clear whether heterotypic boosts would be compromised by original antigenic sin, where pre-existing responses to a prior variant dampen responses to a new one, or whether the memory B cell repertoire would bridge the gap between Wu-Hu-1 and VOCs. We show, in macaques immunized with Wu-Hu-1 spike, that a single dose of adjuvanted beta variant receptor binding domain (RBD) protein broadens neutralizing antibody responses to heterologous VOCs. Passive transfer of plasma sampled after Wu-Hu-1 spike immunization only partially protects K18-hACE2 mice from lethal challenge with a beta variant isolate, whereas plasma sampled following heterotypic RBD boost protects completely against disease.",medicine
34723223,A pathogen-like antigen-based vaccine confers immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates.,Cell Rep Med,"Activation of nucleic acid sensing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in B cells is involved in antiviral responses by promoting B cell activation and germinal center responses. In order to take advantage of this natural pathway for vaccine development, synthetic pathogen-like antigens (PLAs) constructed of multivalent antigens with encapsulated TLR ligands can be used to activate B cell antigen receptors and TLRs in a synergistic manner. Here we report a PLA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine candidate designed by combining a phage-derived virus-like particle carrying bacterial RNA as TLR ligands with the receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) S protein as the target antigen. This PLA-based vaccine candidate induces robust neutralizing antibodies in both mice and non-human primates (NHPs). Using a NHP infection model, we demonstrate that the viral clearance is accelerated in vaccinated animals. In addition, the PLA-based vaccine induces a T helper 1 (Th1)-oriented response and a durable memory, supporting its potential for further clinical development.",medicine

34722924,Impact of the Severity of Liver Injury in COVID-19 Patients Admitted to an Intensive Care Unit During the SARS-CoV2 Pandemic Outbreak.,J Crit Care Med (Targu Mures),"Introduction: The World Health Organization (WHO) identified a novel coronavirus, originating in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a pneumonia causing pathogen. Epidemiological data in Romania show more than 450.000 confirmed patients, with a constant number of approximately 10% admission in intensive care unit. Method: A retrospective, observational study was conducted from 1st March to 30th October 2020, comprising 657 patients, confirmed as having COVID-19, and who had been admitted to the intensive care unit of the Mures County Clinical Hospital, Tirgu Mures, Romania, which had been designated as a support hospital during the pandemic. Patients who presented at admission or developed abnormal liver function tests in the first seven days of admission, were included in the study; patients with pre-existing liver disease, were excluded. Results: The mean (SD) age of patients included in the study was 59.41 (14.66) years with a male: female ratio of 1.51:1. Survivor status, defined as patients discharged from the intensive care unit, was significantly associated with parameters such as age, leukocyte count, albumin level, glycaemia level (p<0.05 for all parameters.). Conclusions: Liver injury expressed through liver function tests cannot solely constitute a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients, but its presence in critically ill patients should be further investigated and included in future guideline protocols.",medicine
34991100,Histopathological and Clinical Analysis of Skin Rashes in Children With Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Associated With COVID-19.,Am J Dermatopathol,"INTRODUCTION: A new entity, which occurs a few weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection and resembling incomplete Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome, has been defined and named multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 in children. The aim of our study was to describe histopathological characteristics of skin lesions of MIS-C patients to reveal whether there is a relationship between histopathological features and clinical manifestations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen who had skin involvement of 57 patients who were diagnosed with MIS-C between December 2020 and February 2021 were included in this prospective study. Demographic information, laboratory findings, and patients' managements were recorded. Skin biopsies were taken simultaneously of each patient. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin samples were examined microscopically. RESULTS: The rate of skin rash was 30% in patients with MIS-C and was predominantly the maculopapular type. The anatomical distribution of the rash was evaluated as localized in 10 and generalized in 7 patients. In patients with myocarditis, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen were found to be significantly higher, and lymphocyte and albumin values were found to be low. Herpes-like inclusions were found in the microscopic examination of 2 patients with a history of zona zoster in themselves or in their mother. There was a significant difference between keratinocyte necrosis and some clinical parameters. DISCUSSION: Localized skin lesions appear to be associated with a more severe inflammatory.",rash
34984055,De Novo Immunoglobulin A Vasculitis Following Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Immunization.,Ochsner J,"Background: Immunizations have been previously described as potential triggering events for the development of certain glomerular diseases. However, glomerular disease occurrences are being reported after exposure to a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Case Report: A 50-year-old male presented to a nephrology clinic for evaluation of persistent proteinuria. Six weeks prior to evaluation, the patient had reported developing a rash 2 weeks after receiving the first dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BNT162b2 mRNA, Pfizer, Inc). His primary care provider treated the rash with corticosteroids, leading to partial improvement of the skin lesions. Three weeks after the first vaccine injection, the patient received his scheduled second vaccine injection. Within 2 days, the rash reappeared. This time, the lesions were more severe in nature. Skin biopsy revealed immunoglobulin A (IgA)-dominant leukocytoclastic vasculitis. After the patient completed 2 weeks of oral corticosteroids, urinalysis revealed proteinuria, and consultation with nephrology was requested. On examination, healing papules were noted on his legs. Serum creatinine 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine was 0.9 mg/dL. Microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed acanthocytes. Urine protein to creatinine ratio 3 weeks after the second dose of vaccine was 1.1 g/day. Serum complements were normal, and all pertinent serology was negative. Kidney biopsy findings were consistent with IgA nephropathy. Conclusion: The clinical presentation and pathologic findings in this case strongly suggest that the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can trigger a clinical syndrome compatible with Henoch-Schonlein purpura. The recurrence of the rash following the second dose argues for a definite causal association by the Naranjo criteria.",rash
34980966,Adverse Effects of COVID-19 and Face Masks: A Systematic Review.,J Clin Aesthet Dermatol,"Background: Due to the public health risk associated with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection, universal use of face masks has been recommended to protect against viral spread. Adverse facial reactions from the utilization of masks in the general public are poorly characterized in literature. Objective: We aimed to provide a systematic review of studies reporting adverse facial reactions associated with use of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched using the following search terms: ""masks"" AND ""skin reactions, facial dermatosis, rash, acne, atopic dermatitis, rosacea, OR seborrheic dermatitis."" Methods: A total of 954 cases of dermatological adverse effects were reported. Over 17 different adverse facial reactions were found, including the top 10 in order: itch (370, 38.8%), indentation/ear pain (102, 10.7%), discomfort (90, 9.4%), erythema (72, 7.5%), dryness (62, 6.5%), rash (60, 6.3%), scarring (42, 4.4%), desquamation (22, 2.3%), pain (19, 2.0%), burning (19, 2.0%), and wheals (7, 0.7%). Face masks can increase acne (n=44), rosacea (n=14), and seborrheic dermatitis (n=9). Limitations: Publication bias of articles, with limited studies available regarding this topic. Conclusion: Wearing face masks to protect from COVID-19 can increase adverse facial dermatoses and exacerbate underlying dermatology conditions; however, several preventative measures may be taken.",rash
34976449,Co-infection With Dengue Virus and Extensively Drug-Resistant Salmonella typhi.,Cureus,"In South Asia, infectious diseases are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Malaria, typhoid, and dengue are the most common infectious diseases, and patients may be co-infected with these diseases, resulting in diagnostic and treatment dilemmas. Dengue is caused by the Arboviridae family of viruses and is transmitted by Aedes aegypti. Dengue virus has four serotypes and the symptoms of dengue fever mimic those of other infectious diseases such as malaria, chikungunya, Zika virus disease, influenza A, enteric fever, and coronavirus disease 2019, which are also prevalent in areas of frequent dengue fever outbreak. Dengue fever is characterized by fever, severe myalgia, retro-orbital pain, skin rashes, and bone pain, which is why dengue fever is also referred to as breakbone fever. Patients with secondary dengue virus infection more commonly present with abdominal pain when compared with those with primary dengue virus infection. Salmonella typhi causes enteric fever, which is a human infection with no animal reservoir, but the symptoms of enteric fever closely resemble those of dengue fever. Concurrent infections with multiple organisms are especially difficult to diagnose. In this report, we present the case of a 15-year-old boy from Peshawar, Pakistan, who was co-infected with the dengue virus and extensively drug-resistant Salmonella typhi. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of co-infection with dengue virus and extensively drug-resistant Salmonella typhi.",rash

After 10 additional days of documented fever >38 degrees C, worsening fatigue, and 1 day of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, she was allowed to schedule an in-person visit with her pediatrician after testing negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. She appeared ill on arrival to clinic, and her pediatrician recommended evaluation in an emergency department. Her initial laboratory testing revealed nonspecific elevation in several inflammatory markers and leukopenia, and she responded well to intravenous hydration. Over the next 2 weeks, her fever persisted, constitutional symptoms worsened, and she developed progressively painful cervical lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia. She was evaluated in clinic by several specialists and eventually was urged to present to the emergency department again, at which time she was admitted to the PICU. After consulting additional specialists and waiting for laboratory results, the team reached a definitive diagnosis and initiated therapy; however, she experienced rapid clinical decline shortly thereafter.

34966708,Case Report: Necrotizing Stomatitis as a Manifestation of COVID-19-Associated Vasculopathy.,Front Pediatr,"Necrotizing stomatitis is a rare, acute-onset disease that is usually associated with severely malnourished children or diminished systemic resistance. We describe a 1-year-old girl who developed necrotizing stomatitis, vasculitic rash, skin desquamation on the fingers and toes, and persistent hypertension after serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Her laboratory investigations revealed positive IgG anticardiolipin and IgG anti-beta2 glycoprotein antibodies, and biopsy of the mucosa of the lower jaw showed necrosis and endothelial damage with mural thrombi. Swollen endothelial cells of small veins in the upper dermis were confirmed also by electron microscopy. As illustrated by our case, necrotizing stomatitis may develop as a rare complication associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be considered as a part of the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 vasculopathy. The pathogenic mechanism could involve a consequence of inflammatory events with vasculopathy, hypercoagulability, and damage of endothelial cells as a response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",rash
34961833,Is It Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or MIS-C with Mucocutaneous Involvement?,Case Rep Pediatr,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) can be present in the form of multisystem inflammatory disease in children. Case Presentation. A 25-month-old boy presented with fever, malaise, diffuse maculopapular rashes, and mucosal involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic. He was first diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). Further evaluation revealed lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and fibrinogen. This was followed by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19. In addition to receiving initial care for SJS, he was treated for MIS-C, which led to his recovery after four days. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection should be considered in children with fever and dermatological features during the pandemic because it may cause different features of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), suggestive of delayed hyperimmune response.",rash

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the acquisition of immunity and the side effects, health status, and lifestyle after completion of the second dose of AZD1222. Blood samples were collected after a second dose of AZD1222. The Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) for anti-S1 antibody, the cPASS SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody detection kit for the surrogate virus neutralization test, and the T-spot Discovery SARS-CoV-2 kit were used to identify cellular immunogenicity. Patient experience of adverse effects was investigated using questionnaires. Information on health status and lifestyle were collected from the most recent health checkup data. Generally, females experience more reactogenicity in both intensity and duration. The rash of the first shot and chills of the second shot were associated with humoral immunity. However, comprehensive adverse effects had no correlation with humoral and cellular immunity. The T-spot-positive group had a higher creatinine level, which reflects muscle mass, than the T-spot-negative group. Males presented a higher level of T-spot assays. Body mass index and age were negatively correlated with the T-spot assay and anti-S1 antibody, respectively. Immune acquisition after the second AZD1222 shot was not associated with reactogenicity. However, individuals' sex, age, and BMI were found to be associated with immunogenicity after vaccination.",rash

The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of rosuvastatin plus colchicine, emtricitabine/tenofovir, and their combined use in these patients. Methods: This was a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicentre, parallel, pragmatic study conducted in six referral hospitals in Bogota, Colombia. The study enrolled hospitalized patients over 18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 complicated with pneumonia, not on chronic treatment with the study medications, and with no contraindications for their use. Patients were assigned 1:1:1:1. 1) emtricitabine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF, 200/300 mg given orally for 10 days); 2) colchicine plus rosuvastatin (COLCH+ROSU, 0.5 mg and 40 mg given orally for 14 days); 3) emtricitabine with tenofovir disoproxil plus colchicine and rosuvastatin at the same doses and for the same period of time (FTC/TDF+COLCH+ROSU); or 4) the Colombian consensus standard of care, including a corticosteroid (SOC). The primary endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality. A modified intention-to-treat analysis was used together with a usefulness analysis to determine which could be the best treatment. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04359095. Findings: Out of 994 candidates considered between August 2020 and March 2021, 649 (65.3%) patients agreed to participate and were enrolled in this study; among them, 633 (97.5%) were included in the analysis. The mean age was 55.4 years (SD +/- 12.8 years), and 428 (68%) were men; 28-day mortality was significantly lower in the FTC/TDF+COLCH+ROSUV group than in the SOC group, 10.7% (17/159) vs. 17.4% (28/161) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.53; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.96). Mortality in the FTC/TDF group was 13.8% (22/160, HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.20) and 14.4% in the COLCH+ROSU group (22/153) (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.36). A lower need for invasive mechanical ventilation was observed in the FTC/TDF+COLCH+ROSUV group than in the SOC group (risk difference [RD] - 0.08, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.04). Three patients presented severe adverse events, one severe diarrhoea in the COLCH+ROSU and one in the FTC/TDF+COLCH+ROSU group and one general exanthema in the FTC/TDF group. Interpretation: The combined use of FTC/TDF+COLCH+ROSU reduces the risk of 28-day mortality and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with pulmonary compromise from COVID-19. More randomized controlled trials are needed to compare the effectiveness and cost of treatment with this combination versus other drugs that have been shown to reduce mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection and its usefulness in patients with chronic statin use.",rash
34938287,The Impact of Age Difference on the Efficacy and Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Front Immunol,"Objective: This meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of five kinds of COVID-19 vaccines in different age groups (young adults and older adults), aiming to analyze the difference of adverse events (AEs) rate and virus geometric mean titer (GMT) values between young and older people, in order to find a specific trend, and explore the causes of this trend through meta-analysis. Method: Meta-analysis was used to analyze the five eligible articles. The modified Jadad scoring scale was used to evaluate the quality of eligible literature with a scoring system of 1 to 7. The primary endpoint of the effectiveness index was GMT. The primary endpoints of the safety index were the incidence of local AEs and systemic AEs. Stata 12.0 software was used for meta-analysis. Revman 5.0 software was used to map the risk of publication bias, and Egger's test was used to analyze publication bias. Results: The GMT values of young adults were higher than older adults (SMD = 1.40, 95% CI (0.79, 2.02), P<0.01). There was a higher incidence of local and systemic AEs in young people than in the elderly (OR = 1.10, 95% CI (1.08, 1.12), P<0.01; OR = 1.18, 95% CI (1.14, 1.22), P<0.01). Conclusion: The immune effect of young people after being vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines was better than that of the elderly, but the safety was worse than that of old people, the most common AEs were fever, rash, and local muscle pain, which were tolerable for young people. As the AEs of the elderly were lower, they can also be vaccinated safely; the reason for the low level of GMT in the elderly was related to Immunosenescence. The vaccine tolerance of people of different ages needs to be studied continuously.",rash

We performed this study to assess the association between KD and COVID-19. We evaluated KD hospitalized children during February to September 2020 for COVID-19 (group one) and compared their demographic, clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic findings with KD patients from the same period time in 2019 (group two). We also compared the same data in COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative KD patients in 2020 pandemic period in Shiraz Namazi referral hospital at southwest of Iran. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients in group one compared with 44 patients in group two. Sixty-eight percent of group one KD patients were positive for COVID-19 during the pandemic period. KD Age of onset in the group one was lower than group two (4.38 years VS 5.5 years, P-value = 0.044). There was no difference in the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic features of the patients during and before the COVID-19 pandemic (p-value > 0.05). Moreover, Comparing COVID-19 positive and negative the incidence of rash was higher within COVID-19 positive cases (p < 0.05), and coronary artery abnormalities were more prevalent in COVID-19 negative cases (p < 0.05).

34863647,Effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy for COVID-19 patients using a risk scoring system.,J Infect Chemother,"INTRODUCTION: Monoclonal antibody therapy has been reported to be highly effective for preventing hospitalisation and severe cases in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, since the drug is not readily available, it is important to rapidly and appropriately identify high-risk patients who can benefit most from therapy. Therefore, we designed a risk scoring system to identify at-risk COVID-19 patients in our region during the largest surge of COVID-19, from July to September 2021. METHODS: According to the risk scores, confirmed COVID-19 patients were introduced to receive REGN-CoV-2 to our hospital by regional health centre from 18th August (Term 3). The primary outcome was the comparison of the number of hospitalisation and severe condition with other periods, the 4th wave (Term 1) and the early part of the 5th wave (Term 2) in Japan. RESULTS: During Term 3, 115 patients were stratified with the scoring system and administered REGN-COV-2. The number of hospitalisation vs severe cases were 60 (5.2%) vs 14 (1.2%), 8 (1.5%) vs 3 (0.6%) and 21 (1.2%) vs 2 (0.1%), in term 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Among those aged <60 years, compared with term 1, the relative risk of hospitalisation and severe condition were 0.25 (95% CI: 0.12-0.53) and 0.10 (95% CI: 0.01-0.80), respectively, in term 3. Drug adverse events were fever (3: 2.6%), headache (1: 0.9%) and neck rash (1: 0.9%), all events were resolved within 24 h wth no serious adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of monoclonal antibody therapy using a risk scoring system significantly reduced the number of hospitalisation and disease severity of COVID-19 without any serious adverse events and avoided regional medical collapse.",rash

Skin findings among Africans differ from Caucasians and it is important to report these in Nigerians with COVID-19. Methods: A prospective observational review involving patients seen at the Emergency triage, and Isolation wards of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. Demographic and clinical data were captured; skin and appendages were examined by a dermatologist between 0800hrs and 1600hours to minimise visual errors of artificial light masking cutaneous lesions. Results: Of 235 participants, 17 (7.23%) had recent onset skin rash, with 7 (41.2%) experienced itching and 11 confirmed with COVID-19. There was a male: female ratio of 97:43 (2.3:1) among COVID-19 patients. Cutaneous findings were seen in 12 (5.1%) participants, with the face and trunk mostly affected and acne plus papular eruptions predominating. There was no significant relationship between COVID-19 and recent onset skin rash (chi2, p = 0.87). Only 2 of the 17 participants had a previously existing dermatoses ((chi2, p = 0.84). There was no significant relation between use of medications and onset of rashes (chi2, p = 0.72) or between those with co-morbidities and onset of rashes (chi2, p = 0.51). Conclusion: Cutaneous manifestations were found among Nigerian patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most presented with pruritus and papular eruptions and no morphologic pattern was demonstrated. Physicians and dermatologists need to be aware and look out for skin changes in SARS-CoV-2 infection as they may be early pointers to COVID-19.

We experienced a rare case of acute appendicitis associated with Kawasaki disease. The patient is a six-year-old male who was brought to the emergency department by his mother with a pruritic rash, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Given fever, tenderness in the right lower quadrant on physical examination, leukocytosis with bandemia, and a non-compressible and dilated appendix on ultrasound, he was diagnosed with acute appendicitis and was treated with a laparoscopic appendectomy. He developed persistent fevers after surgery with new lip swelling, mucositis, and bilateral conjunctival injection. Kawasaki disease was suspected and intravenous gammaglobulin and aspirin were administrated. He made a full recovery. This case suggests that careful examination is needed for accurate diagnosis, especially in patients with postoperative persistent fever without signs of intra-abdominal complications.

Here we aimed to raise awareness for the symptoms of MIS-C in patients with rheumatic diseases, emphasizing the challenges of the differential features. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory and imaging findings, treatments, and outcomes of six MIS-C patients with previous rheumatic disease. RESULTS: Three of the patients had familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), one had juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), one had systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and another patient had oligoarticular JIA. All FMF patients presented with fever and abdominal pain, two also had chest pain. The patient with systemic JIA presented with fever, rash, and myalgia. All patients had elevated inflammatory markers and high d-dimer levels. Chest imaging of two FMF patients showed infiltrations compatible with pneumonia. One FMF patient had mildly decreased systolic functions with a shortening fraction of 48% in his echocardiography. Intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone were administered to all patients. Anakinra was given to four patients. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and laboratory signs of MIS-C may overlap with the findings of various rheumatic diseases, and this may cause a delay in diagnosis.",rash

This study describes detailed clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes of children with COVID-19 in a non-hospitalised and hospitalised setting and quantifies factors associated with admission to hospital and intensive care unit in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection on a nationwide level. Data were collected through the Swiss Paediatric Surveillance Unit from children < 18 years with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. All 33 paediatric hospitals in Switzerland reported non-hospitalised and hospitalised cases from March 1 to October 31, 2020 during both pandemic peaks. In total, 678 children were included. The median age was 12.2 years (IQR 5.0-14.6), 316 (46.6%) were female and 106 (15.6%) had comorbidities. Overall, 126 (18.6%) children were hospitalised of whom 16 (12.7%) required ICU admission. Comorbidities were the only factor associated with hospital admission in a multivariable regression analysis (odds ratio 3.23, 95%CI 1.89 to 5.50; p-value < 0.01). Children with preexisting comorbidities did not require ICU admission more often. Hospitalised children more often presented with fever (96 [76.2%] vs 209 [38.1%], p-value < 0.01) and rash (16 [12.8%] vs 6 [1.1%], p-value < 0.01). Anosmia/dysgeusia was more prevalent in non-hospitalised children (73 [13.3%] vs 3 [2.4%], p-value < 0.01). In hospitalised children, oxygen treatment was required in 34 (27.0%), inotropes in nine (7.3%) and mechanical ventilation in eight (6.3%) cases. Complications were reported in 28 (4.1%) children with cardiovascular complications being most frequent (12 [1.8%]). Three deaths were recorded.Conclusion: This study confirms that COVID-19 is mostly a mild disease in children. Fever, rash and comorbidities are associated with higher admission rates. Continuous observation is necessary to further understand paediatric COVID-19, guide therapy and evaluate the necessity for vaccination in children. What is Known: * Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children vary from asymptomatic to critical disease requiring intensive care unit admission. * Most studies are based on hospitalised children only; currently, there is limited data on non-hospitalised children. What is New: * The clinical spectrum and severity of COVID-19 is influenced by age: in children less than 2 years, fever, cough and rhinorrhoea are the most common symptoms and in adolescents, fever, cough and headache are more common. * Hospitalised children more often presented with fever and rash, while anosmia/dysgeusia is more prevalent in non-hospitalised children. * Children with pre-existing comorbidities are more frequently hospitalised but do not require ICU admission more often.",rash

METHODS: This prospective cohort study included consenting HCWs who completed a questionnaire regarding background illnesses, medications, and post vaccination allergic reactions or rash. All HCWs were tested for anti-spike antibodies (LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay) one and three months after second vaccine dose. A multivariate mixed linear model was adjusted to participant's data and fit to predict antibody levels after second BNT162B2 vaccine dose, based on antibody levels at 1 month and the slope between 3 and 1 month. Multivariate analyses identified factors associated with lower antibody levels. RESULTS: A total of 1,506 HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Older age was associated with lower mean antibody levels (-1.22 AU/ml, p <0.001, 95% CI -1.43 - -1.01). In addition, male (-22.16AU/ml, p <0.001, 95% CI -27.93 - -16.39), underlying condition (-10.86AU/ml, p= 0.007, 95% CI -18.81 - -2.91) and immunosuppressive treatment (-28.57AU/ml, p = 0.002, 95% CI -46.85 - -10.29) were associated with significantly lower mean antibody levels. Allergic reactions after vaccine administration or peri vaccination GCS treatment were not correlated with antibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: Most HCWs had measurable antibodies at 3 months. Risk factors for lower antibody levels were older age, male sex, underlying condition, and immunosuppressive treatment.

Cutaneous adverse reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations have been progressively reported, but they have not been reviewed according to their morphological clinical patterns. The objective of this review was to summarize the existing data concerning the cutaneous adverse reactions following SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and group them according to common morphological and pathogenetic patterns. We reviewed the English language literature up to 15 August 2021, using predefined keywords to identify the relevant studies evaluating cutaneous adverse reactions associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We search for recurrent morphological patterns sharing clinical signs and symptoms and physio-pathological mechanisms. Timing to onset following the first or booster dose of the vaccine, predisposing conditions, therapeutic management, and outcome were also collected. Among the dermatological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, we distinguished: (1) new onset reactions and (2) flares of preexisting dermatoses. The most common were injection site reactions, affecting 30-70% and generally mild or moderate. Small case series or single case reports included filler reactions, exanthemas, vascular lesions, urticaria, eczematous dermatitis, autoimmune bullous reactions, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. In addition, the exacerbation of chronic immuno-mediated dermatoses (mainly psoriasis and atopic dermatitis) and reactivations of herpes infection were reported.

There is a need to determine their association with disease severity, outcome, and other clinical variables. Objectives The objectives of this study are to record and histopathologically examine the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 and correlate these to age, disease severity, and mortality. Methods All confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a single tertiary healthcare hospital in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, were included. Their diseases were classified as mild, moderate, severe, and critical. The recent onset skin eruptions in these patients were recorded via photographs along with relevant clinical data. The photographs were independently reviewed by a group of three dermatologists without knowledge of the clinical information. The skin manifestations were divided into disease-specific and nonspecific categories using an already defined algorithm. Histopathological examination of skin manifestations was conducted. Results A total of 23% (n=47) had ""new"" skin manifestations. Specific skin findings were seen in 21.6% (n=44), which consisted of ecchymosis/purpura in 50% (n=22), maculopapular exanthem in 18% (n=8), livedo reticularis in 16.2% (n=7), ischemia/gangrene in 16.2% (n=7), perniosis in 15.9 % (n=7), vesiculo-bullous rash in 9% (n=4) and urticaria in 4% (n=1). Non-specific findings were seen in 6% (n=13) and included bedsores, dermatitis passivata, dryness, herpes labialis, oral ulcerations, and nasogastric tube-induced ulcerations. There was a significant association (p=0.03) between disease severity and specific skin lesions. Ischemia/gangrene was significantly associated with COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. Vesiculobullous lesions were associated with higher mortality, though not with disease severity. Livedo reticularis had a higher-than-expected count in critical disease, albeit statistically insignificant. The association of maculopapular exanthem and ecchymosis/purpura with severe/critical disease was statistically insignificant. Urticaria was significantly associated with low disease severity. Mean age with specific manifestations was 56.86 +/- 15.81 and with nonspecific/without any manifestations was 42.58 +/- 16.96, a highly significant difference, with p-value < 0.001. Old age (>60 years) was significantly associated with ecchymosis (p=0.038), maculopapular exanthem (p=0.021), and vesiculo-bullous rash (p=0.029). Histopathology varied according to the type of skin lesion. Conclusions Dermatological manifestations coexist in many patients and tend to appear more in severe cases of COVID-19 among the older age group and only minimally in mild/moderate cases. Their presence could help set prognostic criteria of COVID-19 disease in the future.",rash

Methods: We conducted an observational prospective cohort study from April 24 to September 03, 2020, in Burkina Faso to assess (as primary outcome) the clinical, biological, and cardiac (electrocardiographic) safety of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin administered to COVID-19 patients. The main secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and median time of viral clearance. Results: A total of 153 patients were enrolled and followed for 21 days. Among patients who took at least one dose of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (90.1% [138/153]), few clinical adverse events were reported and were mainly rash/pruritus, diarrhea, chest pain, and palpitations. No statistically significant increase in hepatic, renal, and hematological parameters or electrolyte disorders were reported. However, there was a significant increase in the QTc value without exceeding 500ms, especially in those who received chloroquine phosphate. Three adverse events of special interest classified as serious (known from chloroquine derivatives) were recorded namely pruritus, paresthesia, and drowsiness. One case of death occurred. The average onset of SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity was estimated at 7.0 (95% CI: 5.0-10.0) days. Conclusion: Hydroxychloroquine appeared to be well tolerated in treated COVID-19 patients in Burkina Faso. In the absence of a robust methodological approach that could generate a high level of scientific evidence, our results could at least contribute to guide health decisions that should be made based on different sources of scientific evidence including those from our study.",rash

This study was conducted to examine the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine for people who were >/= 75 years of age, specifically those who first took two doses of the vaccine at the COVID-19 central vaccination center in South Korea. METHODS: Safety monitoring after the BNT162b2 vaccine was conducted in three ways for older adults who received the first dose of the vaccine at our center between April 5 and April 23, 2021. For immediate adverse reactions, every person who was vaccinated was observed for 15-30 minutes after injection at the center. For active surveillance, a telephone interview was conducted for stratified randomly sampled people after 7 days of each vaccination to enquire regarding types of adverse reactions they experienced, and its severity and duration. For passive surveillance, reported adverse event data were collected from the COVID-19 vaccine adverse event following immunization (AEFI) surveillance system-run by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). The data were then reviewed. RESULTS: In total, 2,123 older adults received at least one vaccine dose during the study period. The frequency of acute adverse reactions that developed during the observed 15-30 minutes after injection was 8.5 cases per 1,000 doses. None of the reactions was assessed as acute allergic reactions to the vaccine and no cases required special treatment or drug administration. Overall, 638 people were followed up at least once by telephone interview 7 days post vaccination. The overall response rate was 82.3%. The rates of local reactions were 50.3% after the first dose and 45.2% after the second dose, and the rates of systemic reactions were 15.2% and 26.0%, respectively. During the study period, 23 medically attended adverse events (5.4 cases per 1,000 administered doses) were reported to the KDCA AEFI surveillance system. The most common symptoms of medically attended cases were nonspecific general weakness (26%) and dizziness (26%), followed by muscle pain (22%), headache (13%), fever (13%), and skin rash or urticaria (13%). Among them, there were five serious adverse events reported, which required hospitalization, including one death. However, most of them were not related to the vaccines.

34806053,"Telemedicine for healthcare: Capabilities, features, barriers, and applications.",Sens Int,"Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monitor discharged patients and manage their recovery. As a result, it is sufficient to state that telemedicine can create a win-win situation. This paper aims to explore the significant capabilities, features with treatment workflow, and barriers to the adoption of telemedicine in Healthcare. The paper identifies seventeen significant applications of telemedicine in Healthcare. Telemedicine is described as a medical practitioner to diagnose and treat patients in a remote area. Using health apps for scheduled follow-up visits makes doctors and patients more effective and improves the probability of follow-up, reducing missing appointments and optimising patient outcomes. Patients should have an accurate medical history and show the doctor any prominent rashes, bruises, or other signs that need attention through the excellent quality audio-video system. Further, practitioners need file management and a payment gateway system. Telemedicine technologies allow patients and doctors both to review the treatment process. However, this technology supplements physical consultation and is in no way a substitute for a physical consultation.

Dengue fever (DF) is caused by the dengue virus (DENV) from the Flaviviridae family and is transmitted via the bite of the female Aedes aegypti mosquito. COVID-19 pneumonia and dengue fever coinfection is a relatively difficult diagnosis to be established considering the similarities in the clinical manifestation of both diseases. I hereby report an unusual case of dual diagnosis involving COVID-19 pneumonia and dengue fever (DF) on the same day of presentation to the hospital. A 62-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a fever of six days duration associated with chills, rigors, arthralgia, myalgia, and a generalized pinpoint rash over the chest and abdomen. He had contact with a worker who recently tested positive for COVID-19. However, his vital signs were stable with peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SPO2) of 99% under room air. Laboratory investigations showed polycythemia, increased hematocrit levels, and thrombocytopenia. Liver function tests showed evidence of acute hepatitis. Otherwise, the basic metabolic panel and coagulation profile were normal. Viral screens for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. The posterior-anterior chest radiograph of the patient showed ground glass opacity in both middle and lower zones of the lungs, which is mostly peripheral with preservation of lung markings. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test with a cycle threshold (CT) value of 19.97 and positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers on the dengue serology panel on the same day of testing. Predisposing risk factors were chronic medical illnesses (type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease) and exposure to probable COVID-19-infected individuals. The patient fully recovered after treatment with oral paracetamol 1 g four times a day for five days and an intravenous drip of 0.9% sodium chloride for 24 hours.",rash
34797392,A flare of Still's disease following COVID-19 vaccination in a 34-year-old patient.,Rheumatol Int,"Vaccination is a cornerstone for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection during a pandemic. Although the currently used COVID-19 vaccine is considered safe, some concerns persist regarding the likelihood of flares of rheumatic diseases. Still's disease is a rare auto-inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, and the data on the flare of Still's disease following COVID-19 vaccination are limited. Therefore, we hereby present the case of a 34-year-old female patient with Still's disease who experienced a flare after a ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. The patient visited the emergency department complaining of fever, arthralgia, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain and macular salmon-pink rash on her back for the past 2 days. She had maintained low Still's disease activity with etanercept and low-dose glucocorticoid for 14 years. She received the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine 7 days before the flare. Laboratory investigations revealed leucocytosis and elevated serum levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and ferritin. Computed tomography showed no specific findings. She received methylprednisolone pulse therapy, etanercept, and methotrexate for treating the Still's disease flare. However, her symptoms were not fully controlled, and she developed pericarditis, pleuritis, fever and macular rashes expanding to her extremities. After excluding infectious conditions by blood culture and pleural fluid analysis, we administered tocilizumab with methotrexate and prednisolone. Her symptoms and laboratory findings improved significantly, and she was discharged without symptoms 7 days later. Although rare, this case of a patient with Still's disease undergoing a flare following vaccination suggests that close observation of disease activity is warranted following COVID-19 vaccination.",rash
34795537,The Third Wave of the COVID-19 Arrived in Afghanistan: A Severe Case with Skin Manifestation.,Int Med Case Rep J,"The COVID-19 is an ongoing global pandemic that has put the world in a devastating situation. The virus is able to attack multiple body systems and cause a variety of clinical problems ranging from asymptomatic to critical cases. Although young individuals are more likely to suffer milder forms of the disease, critical cases also might happen. Recent literature has revealed that, along with other clinical symptoms, skin manifestations have also progressively grown. In Afghanistan where COVID-19 has entered into a third wave, many people do not take the initial mild symptoms seriously to prevent further spreading in the community. We report symptoms of skin rash, fatigue, muscle pain, dry cough and fever at the onset of the disease, followed by rapid lung damage in a 23-year-old young adult, who did not have any preexisting risk factors. This case highlights the importance of urgent skin assessment of the COVID-19 patient complaining of any skin symptoms.",rash

Here, we highlight the importance of always considering alternative diagnoses, i.e. viral and autoimmune diseases, including anti-MDA5 antibody screening, when dealing with patients with a skin rash, seronegative polyarthralgias and interstitial pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome of unknown origin. LEARNING POINTS: MDA5-associated dermatomyositis is a rare systemic syndrome associated with rapidly progressive and treatment-refractory interstitial lung disease.The anti-MDA5 antibody is the key biomarker for the diagnosis.Early diagnosis is crucial to promptly start aggressive immunosuppressive therapy with the aims of improving prognosis and reducing mortality.",rash
34788266,Zoster Cranial Polyneuropathy in a COVID-19 Patient.,Am J Case Rep,"BACKGROUND Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a rare form of herpes zoster caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion. The main clinical manifestations are peripheral facial palsy, vesicular rash in the ear, and ipsilateral auricular pain, and sometimes vertigo. COVID-19 is a new multisystemic infectious disease that, in addition to common respiratory manifestations, it is known to affect the immune system, primarily depressing cellular immunity. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with an acute vestibular syndrome and diplopia. She had been diagnosed 3 years prior with interstitial lung disease for which she was taking methylprednisolone. At admission, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the following days, she developed a sixth nerve palsy on the left side and a right peripheral facial palsy on the right side, followed by a typical zoster rash on the ipsilateral ear. One month later, she developed acute severe hearing loss on the right side. There were no COVID-19 symptoms during her stay in our hospital. The MRI showed Gd enhancement of both facial nerves. Under antiviral and corticoid treatment, the evolution was favorable, with marked improvement at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 increases the risk for herpes zoster infection, probably through induced depression of the cellular immunity. Our case suggests Ramsay Hunt syndrome can be the presenting symptom and sometimes the only symptom of COVID-19. This also seems to be true for other cranial neuropathies, and we recommend testing these patients even if there are no other manifestations.",rash

34778150,Hematuria as an Early Sign of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children: A Case Report of a Boy With Multiple Comorbidities and Review of Literature.,Front Pediatr,"Introduction: While the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be milder or asymptomatic within the pediatric population, growing attention has been laid to the rare complication elicited by virus, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children temporarily associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C). Published definition and criteria of MIS-C include persistent fever, multisystem involvement, and elevated markers of inflammation, without obvious microbial inflammation or other plausible diagnosis. However, the aim of this case report is to emphasize the diversity of symptoms of MIS-C, beyond the defined criteria. Case Presentation: We present a 10-year-old boy with 8p23.1 microdeletion syndrome and multiple comorbidities who initially came to our attention due to hematuria, persistent fever, rash, and elevated markers of inflammation. Within the next 2 days, his condition worsened despite the broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Assuming his past history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, MIS-C was suspected. A high level of clinical suspicion was further supported by significant clinical features (vomiting, abdominal pain, conjunctivitis, arrhythmia, and mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with pleural effusion) along with laboratory findings (elevated ESR, CRP, proBNP, D-dimers and fibrinogen, positive IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and negative microbiological cultures). The patient was given intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and began to show instantaneous clinical and laboratory improvement. Conclusion: Despite numerous reports of MIS-C cases in children, there are still many uncertainties regarding the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, as well as mechanisms beyond this intriguing disorder. In our case, for the first time hematuria is reported as an early symptom of MIS-C. We strongly believe that reporting various manifestations and outcomes in MIS-C patients will lead to improved diagnosis, treatment, and overall understanding of this novel inflammatory condition.",rash

The present study describes a case of KD shock syndrome that occurred in an infant (age, 16 months) following 7 days of high fever and persistent rash characterized by target-like and purpuric skin lesions. The child developed neurological manifestations such as altered consciousness and irritability. Consequently, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, revealing an inflammatory involvement of the anterior perforated substance and the hypothalamus. Cerebral involvement on brain MRI is rarely described in KD but when reported is characterized mostly by cerebral vasculitis. We illustrate for the first time in KD an inflammation in the brain not related to vasculitis, reporting peculiar neuroradiological findings.

The prospective multicenter study aimed to analyze clinical factors influencing the length of the hospital stay (LoHS) in children with COVID-19. METHODS: The study included 1283 children from 14 paediatric infectious diseases departments with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Children were assessed in respective centres regarding indications for admission to hospital and clinical condition. History data, clinical findings, laboratory parameters, treatment, and outcome, were collected in the paediatric SARSTer register. The group of children with a hospital stays longer than seven days was compared to the remaining patients. Parameters with a statistically significant difference were included in further logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: One thousand one hundred and ten children were admitted to the hospital, 763 children were hospitalized >24 h and 173 children >7 days. 268 children had comorbidities. Two hundred and eleven children had an additional diagnosis with coinfections present in 135 children (11%). Factors increasing the risk of higher LoHS included pneumonia [odds ratio-OR 3.028; 95% confidence interval-CI (1.878-4.884)], gastrointestinal symptoms [OR = 1.556; 95%CI (1.049-2.322)], or rash [OR = 2.318; 95%CI (1.216-4.418)] in initial clinical findings. Comorbidities [OR = 2.433; 95%CI (1.662-3.563)], an additional diagnosis [OR = 2.594; 95%CI (1.679-4.007)] and the necessity of the empirical antibiotic treatment [OR = 2.834; 95%CI (2.834-6.713)] were further factors related to higher LoHS. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course of COVID-19 was mild to moderate in most children.

COVID-19 vaccination side effects, such as fever, which occur in up to 10% of people following COVID-19 vaccination, can make the diagnosis of acute HIV infection even more challenging. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old man presented with fever and headache following COVID-19 vaccination. The symptoms were initially thought to be vaccine side effects. A diagnostic workup was conducted due to persisting fever and headache > 72 h following vaccination, and he was diagnosed with Fiebig stage II acute HIV infection, 3 weeks after having unprotected anal intercourse with another man. CONCLUSION: Thorough anamnesis is key to estimating the individual risk of primary HIV infection, in patients presenting with flu-like symptoms.

34699709,A Case of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Presenting as Acute Appendicitis and Pancreatitis.,Pril (Makedon Akad Nauk Umet Odd Med Nauki),"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is characterized by an inflammation with fever, elevated inflammatory markers, conjunctivitis, rash, impaired coagulation, gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiac abnormalities that may progress to multiorgan failure. The presence of a positive COVID-19 antigen via a PCR test, serological testing for antibodies or close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 helps differentiate MIS-C from other diseases. Gastrointestinal symptoms are recognized to be associated with COVID-19 infection or MIS-C in children, presenting as abdominal pain, gastrointestinal infection with watery stools, appendicitis, ileitis, pancreatitis and hepatitis, confusing the diagnosis with other gastrointestinal diseases. In this case report, we describe an 11 year old boy with MIS-C, who presents acute phlegmona of the appendix for which he undergoes appendectomy, accompanied with acute pancreatitis. These manifestations of MIS-C in our patient resolved without additional complications after a 2 month follow up. We call attention to MIS-C presenting in pediatric patients with fever and abdominal pain which might be caused by appendicitis and pancreatitis, and we recommend abdominal imaging and additional laboratory investigation to promote earlier diagnosis.",rash

This hyper-inflammatory syndrome is seen predominantly in children and adolescents. The case of an adult from the Maldives who had asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection three weeks before presenting to the hospital with fever, rash, and shock is presented. De-identified clinical data were retrospectively collected to summarize the clinical progression and treatment during hospitalization and the six-month follow-up. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR. Other laboratory findings included anemia (hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL), leukocytosis (leukocytes: 20,900/microL), neutrophilia (neutrophils: 18,580/microL) and lymphopenia (lymphocytes: 5067/microL), and elevated inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (34.8 mg/dL) and ferritin (2716.0 ng/dL). The electrocardiogram had low-voltage complexes, and the echocardiogram showed hypokinesia, ventricular dysfunction, and a pericardial effusion suggestive of myocardial dysfunction compromising hemodynamics and causing circulatory shock. These findings fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of MIS-A. The case was managed in the intensive care unit and required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, inotropes, and steroids. With the new surges of COVID-19 cases, more cases of MIS-A that require the management of organ failure and long-term follow-up to recovery are anticipated.

However, an increasing number of cutaneous manifestations associated with this disease have been reported. The aim of this study is to analyze the scientific literature on cutaneous manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 by means of a narrative literature review until June 2021. The search was conducted in the following electronic databases: Medline (PubMed), SciELO, and Cochrane Library Plus. The most common cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 are vesicular eruptions, petechial/purpuric rashes, acral lesions, liveoid lesions, urticarial rash, and maculopapular-erythematous rash. These manifestations may be the first presenting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as is the case with acral lesions, vesicular eruptions, and urticaria. In relation to severity, the presence of liveoid lesions may be associated with a more severe course of the disease. Treatment used for dermatological lesions includes therapy with anticoagulants, corticosteroids, and antihistamines. Knowledge of the dermatologic manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 contributes to the diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients with skin lesions associated with respiratory symptoms or in asymptomatic patients.

34670262,Cutaneous coronavirus disease 2019 in children: a clinical primer for diagnosis and treatment.,Curr Opin Pediatr,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines the global literature regarding rashes encountered in children and adults infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and aims to provide practicing pediatricians with an understanding of the relationship between instances of rashes and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children in order to effectively evaluate and treat patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The true incidence of cutaneous reactions in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Children's immune systems differ from those of adults and rashes as a manifestation of immune responses, in turn, differ in morphology and distribution. Rarely, children develop a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome that has overlapping clinical features with Kawasaki disease. In addition, vaccinations produce rashes similar to natural infections. The rashes associated with COVID-19 vaccination are mild and transient, and should not preclude vaccination. Lastly, children who chronically wear masks are more likely to experience flaring of acne around the nose and mouth ('maskne') and facial conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis. SUMMARY: There are ongoing worldwide registries, clinical and basic science studies to better understand the burden of skin disease and pathophysiology of rashes seen in patients infected with COVID-19. Robust vaccination programs should be encouraged as a way to contain viral spread among children and the greater population.",rash

All children meeting the World Health Organization case definition of MIS-C were prospectively enrolled. Baseline clinical and laboratory parameters were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Enrolled subjects were followed up for 4-6 weeks for evaluation of cardiac outcomes using echocardiography. The statistical data were analyzed using the stata-12 software. Thirty-one children with MIS-C were enrolled in an 11-month period. Twelve children had preexisting chronic systemic comorbidity. Fever was a universal finding; gastrointestinal and respiratory manifestations were noted in 70.9% and 64.3%, respectively, while 57.1% had a skin rash. Fifty-eight percent of children presented with shock, and 22.5% required mechanical ventilation. HSP like rash, gangrene and arthritis were uncommon clinical observations.The median duration of hospital stay was 9 (6.5-18.5) days: four children with preexisting comorbidities succumbed to the illness. The serum ferritin levels (ng/ml) [median (IQR)] were significantly higher in non-survivors as compared to survivors [1061 (581, 2750) vs 309.5 (140, 720.08), p value = 0.045]. Six patients had coronary artery involvement; five recovered during follow-up, while one was still admitted. Twenty-six children received immunomodulatory drugs, and five improved without immunomodulation. The choice of immunomodulation (steroids or intravenous immunoglobulin) did not affect the outcome. Most children with MIS-C present with acute hemodynamic and respiratory symptoms.The outcome is favorable in children without preexisting comorbidities.Raised ferritin level may be a poor prognostic marker. The coronary outcomes at follow-up were reassuring.",rash
34661927,Cutaneous findings following COVID-19 vaccination: review of world literature and own experience.,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"There is growing evidence that not only the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) but also the COVID-19 vaccines can cause a variety of skin reactions. In this review article, we provide a brief overview on cutaneous findings that have been observed since the emerging mass COVID-19 vaccination campaigns all over the world. Unspecific injection-site reactions very early occurring after the vaccination are most frequent. Type I hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. urticaria, angio-oedema and anaphylaxis) likely due to allergy to ingredients may rarely occur but can be severe. Type IV hypersensitivity reactions may be observed, including delayed large local skin lesions (""COVID arm""), inflammatory reactions in dermal filler or previous radiation sites or even old BCG scars, and more commonly morbilliform and erythema multiforme-like rashes. Autoimmune-mediated skin findings after COVID-19 vaccination include leucocytoclastic vasculitis, lupus erythematosus and immune thrombocytopenia. Functional angiopathies (chilblain-like lesions, erythromelalgia) may also be observed. Pityriasis rosea-like rashes and reactivation of herpes zoster have also been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. In conclusion, there are numerous cutaneous reaction patterns that may occur following COVID-19 vaccination, whereby many of these skin findings are of immunological/autoimmunological nature. Importantly, molecular mimicry exists between SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. the spike-protein sequences used to design the vaccines) and human components and may thus explain some COVID-19 pathologies as well as adverse skin reactions to COVID-19 vaccinations.",rash

OBJECTIVE: To review what is currently known about multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, including physiology, signs and symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment options, and nursing considerations in critical care settings. METHODS: This integrative review was conducted using the keywords multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, Kawasaki-like syndrome, COVID, COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2. Initially, 324 articles were found. All were screened, and 34 were included. Eight articles were added after hand-searching and weekly literature searches were conducted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is a newly identified syndrome, thus information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes is available but evolving. Many aspects of nursing care are important to consider with regard to this illness, including COVID precautions, physical assessments, medication administration, and timing of blood sampling for laboratory testing as well as other standard intensive care unit considerations. Providing anticipatory guidance and support to patients and their families is also important. CONCLUSION: Critical care nurses must remain informed about advances in the care of patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, as these patients are often seen in critical care environments because of their high risk of cardiovascular failure.",rash

The overall pooled prevalence estimate of anaphylaxis to both vaccines was 5.0 (95% CI 2.9 to 7.2, I(2) = 81%, p = < 0.0001), while the overall pooled prevalence estimate of nonanaphylactic reactions to both vaccines was 53.9 (95% CI 0.0 to 116.1, I(2) = 99%, p = < 0.0001). Vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech resulted in higher anaphylactic reactions compared to Moderna (8.0, 95% CI 0.0 to 11.3, I(2) = 85% versus 2.8, 95% CI 0.0 to 5.7, I(2) = 59%). However, lower incidence of nonanaphylactic reactions was associated with Pfizer-BioNTech compared to Moderna (43.9, 95% CI 0.0 to 131.9, I(2) = 99% versus 63.8, 95% CI 0.0 to 151.8, I(2) = 98%). The funnel plots for possible publication bias for the pooled effect sizes to determine the incidence of anaphylaxis and nonanaphylactic reactions associated with mRNA COVID-19 immunization based on mRNA vaccine type appeared asymmetrical on visual inspection, and Egger's tests confirmed asymmetry by producing p values < 0.05. Across the included studies, the most commonly identified risk factors for anaphylactic and nonanaphylactic reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were female sex and personal history of atopy. The key triggers to anaphylactic and nonanaphylactic reactions identified in these studies included foods, medications, stinging insects or jellyfish, contrast media, cosmetics and detergents, household products, and latex. Previous history of anaphylaxis; and comorbidities such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic and contact eczema/dermatitis and psoriasis and cholinergic urticaria were also found to be important. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-associated anaphylaxis is very low; and nonanaphylactic reactions occur at higher rate, however, cutaneous reactions are largely self-limited. Both anaphylactic and nonanaphylactic reactions should not discourage vaccination.",rash
34653529,"Medical masks' and respirators' pattern of use, adverse effects and errors among Portuguese health care professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study.",Am J Infect Control,"BACKGROUND: During COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of surgical masks (Mask) and respirators (Resp) was experienced worldwide. We aimed to assess its pattern of use, adverse effects and user errors by Portuguese health care professionals (HCP). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through snowball convenience sample, collected by email/ social media to health care organizations. Participants answered an online anonymous survey in March 2021. RESULTS: Mean age of 3052 respondents was 42.1 years old, 83.6% were female and 77.8% provided direct health care to COVID-19 patients. Mean time of use per shift was 6-8 hours in 40.8% of the participants. 28.0% reported never changing it during their shift. Resp use (vs Mask) was more associated with discomfort (58.2% vs 26.8%), affecting task performance (41.5 vs 18.9%) and communication (55.0 vs 40.9%), dyspnea (36.0 vs 14.4%), skin rash (37.5 vs 19.4%) and headache (37.5 vs 19.4%). Frequent user errors included touching the front while in use (70.1% Mask vs 66.3% Resp) and omitting hand hygiene before (61.8% Mask vs 55.0% Resp) or after use (61.3% Mask vs 57.0% Resp). Average number of errors was higher for Mask (4.3), than for Resp (3.2) (all: P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Most HCP admitted an extended use of Mask/ Resp. Resp were more prone to adverse effects and Mask more prone to errors. Strategies to reinforce good practices should be considered.",rash
34646566,Five days of fever and myocardial inflammation.,SAGE Open Med Case Rep,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is an emerging pediatric illness associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. The syndrome is rare, and evidence-based guidelines are lacking. This report reviews a patient who presented for medical care multiple times early in the course of his illness, thus offering near-daily documentation of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. The patient did not have thrombocytopenia, anemia, or myocardial inflammation until the fifth day of fever. These laboratory abnormalities coincided with the onset of rash, conjunctival injection, vomiting, and diarrhea: clinical signs that could serve as indicators for when to obtain blood tests. The timing of this patient's onset of multisystem involvement suggests that testing for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children after only 24 h of fever, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends, may yield false-negative results. Testing for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children after 4 days of fever may be more reliable.",rash
34642609,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome with Features of Atypical Kawasaki Disease during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,Case Rep Pediatr,"Background: Although Kawasaki disease (KD) is the most common self-limited systemic vasculitis in pediatrics, the exact etiology of the disease, its association with other diseases, and pathogens is still unknown. In order to achieve a better understanding and management of the disease, documentation and reporting of atypical cases is justified, particularly with the growing number of children with inflammatory syndrome with clinical features simulating KD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we present a case of an atypical case of KD presenting as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Case Presentation. The patient is a 7-year-old girl who developed fever (39 degrees C) and erythematous multiform rash on the abdomen and along with erythema and edema on the extremities. Laboratory evaluation revealed neutrophilia and lymphopenia along with elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, troponin, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and D-dimer. Although the patient did not fulfill the KD criteria, based on approved guidelines and approaches regarding atypical KD and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) during the COVID-19 pandemic, intravenous immunoglobulin along with aspirin was administered for the patients. The patient's symptoms resolved with an uneventful postdischarge course. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and treatment of patients meeting full or partial criteria for KD are critical to preventing end-organ damage and other long-term complications, especially during times of public crisis and global health emergencies, such as the novel coronavirus pandemic.",rash

However, the skin side effects of the medications used for COVID-19, such as famotidine, have not been studied. <P> Objective: This case series aim to present our challenge to define cutaneous manifestations between famotidine and COVID-19. <P> Methods: We identified patients from Imam Khomeini hospital complex who were admitted to the ward with confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) taking famotidine and having cutaneous rash. Clinical data were obtained through observation and intervention. <P> Results: We found 4 SARS-COV-2 patients with cutaneous manifestations. The mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 57+/-2 years, 3 patients were men, and COVID-19 symptoms began 10+/-3 days before admission. The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath. All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Patients received famotidine for gastrointestinal prophylaxis, and all 4 patients developed Acral macular mountainous skin lesion in the upper and lower extremities, then we discontinued famotidine and lesions were recovered completely in all patients. <P> Conclusion: These cases prompted us to inform clinicians about cutaneous complications of famotidine in COVID-19 patients.",rash
34622531,Cutaneous adverse reactions after COVID-19 vaccines in a cohort of 2740 Italian subjects: An observational study.,Dermatol Ther,"An in-depth characterization of the incidence, morphology, and onset of COVID-19-vaccines cutaneous adverse reactions is currently lacking. The existing literature on COVID-19 vaccination-related cutaneous adverse reactions largely focused on messenger RNA vaccines and mainly included type 1 hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria and angioedema. Other cutaneous manifestations are still poorly characterized and have been classified as delayed hypersensitivity rash. Our prospective observational study on a sample of 2740 subjects who underwent the COVID-19 vaccination aimed at defining the prevalence of cutaneous adverse reactions and at identifying their timing of onset and their correlation with the administered dose. Vaccine-related cutaneous adverse reactions occurred in 50 subjects. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire on the type of COVID-19 vaccine received, the time of onset of cutaneous reactions, and the dates of administration. Out of 2740 individuals who received the COVID-19 vaccination, 50 were diagnosed with cutaneous adverse reactions to vaccine, after the first dose in 28 patients, after the second in 20, and after both in two. We reported localized injection site erythema in 12 patients and generalized cutaneous reactions in 38 patients. Our study shows that cutaneous adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccination are not common and most often occur after the first dose, recurring infrequently after the second dose. These reactions are usually easily manageable and, even in severe generalized cases, oral antihistamines and corticosteroids were sufficient for resolution. Therefore, except for immediate hypersensitivity reactions, cutaneous adverse reactions do not represent a contraindication to the completion of the vaccination cycle.",rash

Our patient was a 48-year-old man who presented with frank haematuria, a widespread petechial rash, and headaches, 2 weeks after receiving the first dose of the Oxford AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. He had a platelet count of 14x10(9)/L and an extensive cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with subarachnoid haemorrhage on imaging. He developed localising neurological signs and experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest. He was successfully resuscitated and transferred to a tertiary care centre for urgent thrombectomy. This case illustrates how the diagnosis of VITT should be based on the platelet count and imaging-and how patients with VITT should be cared for in centres with urgent neurosurgical and interventional radiology services.",rash

This may result in misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, and lead to further transmission in the community. We aimed to derive early predictors to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza and dengue. The study comprised 126 patients with COVID-19, 171 with influenza and 180 with dengue, who presented within 5 days of symptom onset. All cases were confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests. We used logistic regression models to identify demographics, clinical characteristics and laboratory markers in classifying COVID-19 versus influenza, and COVID-19 versus dengue. The performance of each model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Shortness of breath was the strongest predictor in the models for differentiating between COVID-19 and influenza, followed by diarrhoea. Higher lymphocyte count was predictive of COVID-19 versus influenza and versus dengue. In the model for differentiating between COVID-19 and dengue, patients with cough and higher platelet count were at increased odds of COVID-19, while headache, joint pain, skin rash and vomiting/nausea were indicative of dengue. The cross-validated area under the ROC curve for all four models was above 0.85. Clinical features and simple laboratory markers for differentiating COVID-19 from influenza and dengue are identified in this study which can be used by primary care physicians in resource limited settings to determine if further investigations or referrals would be required.",rash

34605352,The clinical course and short-term health outcomes of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in the single pediatric rheumatology center.,Postgrad Med,"OBJECTIVES: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but severe condition resulting in excessive response of the immune system after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We report a single-center cohort of children with MIS-C, describing the spectrum of presentation, therapies, clinical course, and short-term outcomes. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study from to a tertiary pediatric rheumatology center including patients (aged 1 month to 21 years) diagnosed with MIS-C between April 2020-April 2021. Demographic, clinical, laboratory results and follow-up data were collected through the electronic patient record system and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients with MIS-C were included in the study. Fever was detected in all patients; gastrointestinal system symptoms were found in 67.2% of the patients, rash in 38.8%, conjunctivitis in 31.3%, hypotension in 26.9% myocarditis, and/or pericarditis in 22.4%, respectively. Respiratory symptoms were only in five patients (7.5%). Kawasaki Disease like presentation was found 37.3% of the patients. The mean duration of hospitalization was 11.8 7.07 days. Fifty-seven patients (85%) received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), 45 (67%) received corticosteroids, 17 (25.3%) received anakinra, and one (1.5%) received tocilizumab. Seven of the patients (10.4%) underwent therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). In 21 (31.3%) patients, a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was required in a median of 2 days. The first finding to improve was fever, while the first parameter to decrease was ferritin (median 6.5 days (IQR, 4-11.2 days)). Sixty-five patients were discharged home with a median duration of hospital stay of 10 days (IQR, 7-15 days). CONCLUSION: Patients with MIS-C may have severe cardiac findings and intensive care requirements in admission and hospital follow-up. The vast majority of these findings improve with effective treatment without any sequelae until discharge and in a short time in follow-up. Although the pathogenesis and treatment plan of the disease are partially elucidated, follow-up studies are needed in terms of long-term prognosis and relapse probabilities.",rash
34603573,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on measles surveillance in the World Health Organisation African Region, 2020.",Pan Afr Med J,"Introduction: following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries imposed restrictions on public gatherings, health workers were repurposed for COVID-19 response, and public demand for preventive health services declined due to fear of getting COVID-19 in health care settings. These factors led to the disruption in health service delivery, including childhood immunization, in the first months of the pandemic. Measles surveillance supported with laboratory confirmation, is implemented in the African Region as part of the strategies towards attaining measles elimination. World Health Organisation developed guidelines to assist countries to continue to safely provide essential health services including immunization and the surveillance of vaccine preventable diseases during the pandemic. Methods: we analysed the measles case-based surveillance and laboratory databases for the years 2014 to 2020, to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on measles surveillance, comparing the performance in 2020 against the preceding years. Results: the weekly reporting of suspected measles cases declined starting in April 2020. Twelve countries had more than 50% decline in both the number of reported cases as well as in the number of specimens collected in 2020, as compared to the mean for the years 2014-2018. In 2020, only 30% of the specimens from suspected measles cases arrived at the national laboratory within 3 days of collection. At Regional level, 86% of the districts reported suspected measles cases in 2020, while the non-measles febrile rash illness rate was 2.1 per 100,000 population, which was the lowest rate documented since 2014. Only 11 countries met the targets for the two principal surveillance performance indicators in 2020 as compared to an average of 21 countries in the years 2014-2019. Conclusion: the overall quality of measles surveillance has declined during the COVID pandemic in many countries. Countries should implement immediate and proactive measures to revitalise active surveillance for measles and monitor the quality of surveillance. We recommend that countries consider implementing specimen collection and testing methods that can facilitate timely confirmation of suspected measles cases in remote communities and areas with transportation challenges.",rash

Both clinical conditions occur with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review aims to recognize the novel association of IgAN and IgAV with COVID-19 and describe its underlying pathogenesis. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search and data extraction from PubMed, Cochrane, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Our search identified 13 cases reporting IgAV and IgAN associated with COVID-19 infection and 4 cases of IgAN following COVID-19 vaccination. The mean, mode, and median ages of patients were 23.8, 4, and 8 years, respectively. Most cases associated with COVID-19 infection were reported in males (77%). Rash and purpura (85%) were the most common clinical features, followed by gastrointestinal symptoms (62%). In symptomatic cases, skin or renal biopsy and immunofluorescence confirmed the diagnosis of IgAN or IgAV. Most patients were treated with steroids and reported recovery or improvement; however, death was reported in two patients. Conclusion: There is a paucity of scientific evidence on the pathogenesis of the association of IgAN and IgAV with COVID-19, which thus needs further study. Current research suggests the role of IgA-mediated immune response, evidenced by early seroconversion to IgA in COVID-19 patients and the role of IgA in immune hyperactivation as the predominant mediator of the disease process. Clinicians, especially nephrologists and paediatricians, need to recognize this association, as this disease is usually self-limited and can lead to complete recovery if prompt diagnosis and treatment are provided.",rash

It has been postulated that dermal ischemia triggers an exaggerated vasoconstrictive arteriolar reaction, which then causes a paradoxical urticarial rash by an unknown mechanism. In patients with COVID-19, there is evidence of angiocentric inflammation leading to vasoconstriction, endothelial damage, and thrombosis.

Including this laboratory parameter, clinical symptoms similar to COVID-19 have been observed in adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and septic shock, which has led to the proposal of a concept called 'hyperferritinemic syndromes.' Additionally, high levels of some clinical markers in both COVID-19 and AOSD make them difficult to differentiate. While the efficacy of ciclesonide had been expected for mild pneumonia with COVID-19, the efficacy of tocilizumab, which is a known treatment for AOSD, was not established. Here, we report the first known occurrence of COVID-19, diagnosed in March 2020, preceded by the diagnosis of AOSD, in April 2019, in a 65-year-old, otherwise healthy man. Following the diagnosis of the latter, the patient was first given prednisolone and then tocilizumab, which led to remission. With the recurrence of joint pain and rash in March 2020, accompanied by low oxygen saturation levels (90%), and ground-glass appearance on chest CT, PCR test revealed COVID-19 infection. Ciclesonide was started on day 7 of the disease onset, which led to improved inflammatory markers by day 21. Thus, we infer that while tocilizumab is theoretically useful for COVID-19 due to its inhibition of interleukin 6 (IL-6), additional ciclesonide therapy might be required to prevent worsening of the condition. AOSD and COVID-19 must, therefore, be differentiated by levels of ferritin which differ between the two, and appropriate treatment must be allocated.",rash

34568135,Seroprevalence trends of Scrub typhus among the febrile patients of Northern India: A prospective cross-sectional study.,J Family Med Prim Care,"Background: Rickettsial infections remain one of the most neglected and underdiagnosed tropical diseases in the developing countries. Scrub typhus can prove to an important diagnosis in pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) patients and is transmitted by a species of trombiculid mites (""chiggers""). The disease leads to a plethora of symptoms like fever, rash, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia, etc. The current study was aimed to assess the seroprevalence as well as other demographic parameters of scrub typhus among patients diagnosed with PUO in the northern part of India. Materials and Methods: This study was undertaken for a period of 3 years from September 2017 to September 2020. Serum samples of suspected cases were tested for IgM Scrub typhus along with other common febrile illnesses like Malaria, typhoid, dengue, leptospirosis, chikengunya, etc. Additional testing for COVID-19 was also planned for samples received after February 2020. Results: The overall seroprevalence of Scrub typhus during the 3 year study period was noted to be 18.6% in the PUO patients. Typhoid was noted in 39.5%, malaria in 9.2%, Dengue in 13.5%, leptospirosis in 4.8%, and chikungunya in 5.3% of the patients. No cause was identified in 9.1% of the PUO cases. 3.9% of the samples were positive by RT-PCR for COVID-19. No mortality was noted in the scrub typhus positive cases. Conclusion: Scrub typhus is an emerging tropical rickettsial disease in the Indian subcontinent. The present study highlights the importance of screening of PUO cases for this important infection as timely institution of simple empirical treatment can prove to be life saving in such positive cases.",rash
34562965,Skin Adverse Reactions to Novel Messenger RNA Coronavirus Vaccination: A Case Series.,Diseases,"Vaccines are actually the most effective strategy to control the COVID-19 spread and reduce mortality, but adverse reactions can occur. Skin involvement with novel messenger RNA coronavirus vaccines seems frequent but is not completely characterized. A real-world experience in the recent vaccination campaign among health care workers in Sardinia (Italy) is reported. In over a total of 1577 persons vaccinated, 9 cases of skin adverse reactions were observed (0.5%). All reactions have been reported to the Italian Pharmacovigilance Authority. Eight occurred in women (mean age 46 years), and five were physicians and four nurses. All patients had a significant allergology history but not for the known vaccine excipients. After dose one, no injection site reactions were observed, but widespread pruritus (n = 3), mild facial erythema (n = 1), and maculopapular rash (n = 3) occurred in the following 24-48 h in three patients. These three patients were excluded from the second dose. Of the remaining six patients, one developed mild anaphylaxis within the observation period at the vaccination hub and five delayed facial erythematous edema and maculopapular lesions, requiring antihistamines and short-course corticosteroid treatment. Spontaneous reporting is paramount to adjourning vaccination guidance and preventive measures in order to contribute to the development of a safe vaccine strategy.

Although first appreciated to cause pneumonia, numerous organ systems are now known to be involved. The objective of this article is to review the broad spectrum of cutaneous manifestations reported in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most commonly reported cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection include pernio (chilblain)-like acral lesions, morbilliform (exanthematous) rash, urticaria, vesicular (varicella-like) eruptions, and vaso-occlusive lesions (livedo racemosa, retiform purpura). It is important to consider SARS-CoV-2 infection in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with these lesions in the appropriate clinical context, as cutaneous manifestations may be present in otherwise asymptomatic individuals, or present before developing other symptoms of infection.

METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE and Embase databases for SARS-CoV-2-related studies. Meta-analysis, observational studies, case series and case reports published in English or Chinese between 1 January and 1 May 2020 were included. Reports with only paediatric or obstetric cases were excluded. RESULTS: 169 articles were included. Early manifestations (preceding respiratory symptoms until Day 6 of onset) included olfactory and gustatory disturbance (self-reported in up to 68% and 85% of cases, respectively), gastrointestinal symptoms (up to 65.9%) and rash (up to 20.4%). From Day 7 onwards, hypercytokinaemia, paralleled multi-organ complications including acute cardiac injury (pooled incidence of 17.7% in 1,412 patients, mostly with severe disease and 17.4% mortality), kidney and liver injury (up to 17% and 33%, respectively) and thrombocytopenia (up to 30%). Hypercoagulability resulted in venous thromboembolic events in up to 31% of all patients. Uncommon disease presentation and complications comprised Guillain-Barre syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, otitis media, meningoencephalitis and spontaneous pneumomediastinum. CONCLUSION: Although the systemic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are variegated, they are deeply interwoven by shared mechanisms. Two phases of extrapulmonary disease were identified: (a) an early phase with possible gastrointestinal, ocular and cutaneous involvement and (b) a late phase characterised by multiorgan dysfunction and clinical deterioration.

As for clinical symptoms, 70 (81.4%) CI children suffered fever, and 34 (39.5%) patients had lung involvement. Meanwhile, 65.1% of patients had cardiac involvement, 4.7% of patients were asymptomatic, and 71.6% of patients received intravenous immunoglobulin, as well as 31.1% of CI children received systemic corticosteroids. Three children were dead. The most frequent route of infection was familial clustering. As silent virus carriers of CI children, it is important to find out the clinical and cutaneous manifestations in CI children to prevent and control COVID-19 transmission.",rash
34527471,A Case of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in a Pediatric Patient With Acute Appendicitis.,Cureus,"This case report details the clinical course of a 7-year-old patient with an initial presentation of acute appendicitis, who developed symptoms highly concerning multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) after appendectomy. Despite appropriate management, the patient went on to develop left main coronary artery dilatation. Given the spectrum of clinical presentations and absence of pathognomonic findings or diagnostic tests for MIS-C, it is essential to maintain a high index of suspicion for MIS-C when pediatric patients first present with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms and recent exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Importantly, this case illustrates that the diagnosis of MIS-C can be missed in three different ways: 1) if the patient has an absence of classic symptoms such as rash, conjunctivitis, edema, or evidence of mucocutaneous involvement on initial presentation; 2) if the patient initially has leukocytosis, instead of leukopenia (which is more prevalent in MIS-C cases), and a normal platelet count early on in the disease course; and 3) if providers confuse MIS-C for other more common postoperative causes of fever, such as atelectasis. Finally, MIS-C should still be considered part of the differential even if abdominal computer tomography (CT) findings are unremarkable for systemic inflammation. Given the potential for a rapid clinical decline in patients with MIS-C, appropriate workup should be completed in a timely manner.",rash
34526148,International study of 24-h movement behaviors of early years (SUNRISE): a pilot study from Bangladesh.,Pilot Feasibility Stud,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) released guidelines for physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep for children under 5 years of age in 2019. In response to these guidelines, this pilot study aimed to (i) determine the proportion of preschool children (ages 3-4 years) who met the WHO guidelines; (ii) examine the feasibility of the proposed protocol for the SUNRISE study; and (iii) assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on movement behaviors of preschool children in Bangladesh. METHODS: Time spent in physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep were objectively measured using two types of accelerometers (ActiGraph wGT3x-BT and ActivPAL4). Screen time and sleep quality were assessed via parent questionnaire. Fine and gross motor skills were measured using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (3rd edition). Three executive functions were assessed using the Early Years Toolbox. Focus groups were conducted with parents and childcare staff to determine the feasibility of the protocol. Follow-up data during COVID-19 pandemic was collected from parents over phone. RESULTS: Data from 63 preschool-aged children and their parents was analyzed in this pilot study. Only three children (4.7%) met all components of the WHO guidelines. Separately, children meeting physical activity, sedentary screen time and sleep guidelines were 71.9%, 17.5%, and 59.7% respectively. The proportion of all children who were developmentally on-track for the gross and fine motor skills was 58.7% and 50.8%, respectively. Parents and educators reported that the protocol was feasible except for the activPAL-4 accelerometer. Approximately, 39% of children (14 out of 37) who wore this device developed itchy skin and rashes resulting in the suspension of using this device mid-way through data collection. During COVID-19, there was a significant decrease in children's total physical activity (- 193 min/day), and time spent outside on weekdays (- 75 min/day) and weekend days (- 131 min/day) and a significant increase in sedentary screen time (+85 min/day). CONCLUSION: Only a low proportion of children met the WHO guidelines. Methods and devices (except ActivPAL4) used in this pilot study proved to be feasible and this has paved the way to conduct the main SUNRISE study in Bangladesh. Future measures should be taken to address the issue of movement behaviors of children during the time of pandemics like COVID-19.",rash
34525782,[Cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 with significant attention to urticaria].,Rev Alerg Mex,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the most frequent dermatological conditions observed in COVID-19 patients and to determine whether their presence could be used to establish an early diagnosis or to predict the progression of the infection. METHODS: There was a review in PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE of all the articles that had been published between January 1st and November 1st, 2020, with the search terms focused on ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"" and ""Skin diseases"". RESULTS: Eighty three studies met the inclusion criteria. Skin lesions have been reported in 0.2 % of the patients. The most frequently reported dermatoses were: maculopapular/ morbilliform rashes, urticaria and angioedema, chilblain-like acral pattern, and vesicular lesions. Among researchers, there are differences of opinion about a possible diagnostic or prognostic value of the skin diseases that are associated to the infection. CONCLUSIONS: It is advisable to consider the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who call the doctor for skin lesions, urticaria, or angioedema, with or without other symptoms of the infection, especially if there is a previous history of recent exposure to other infected subjects.",rash
34523885,Kawasaki Disease and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children: An Overview and Comparison.,Am Fam Physician,"Kawasaki disease (KD) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) are inflammatory conditions that present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to the physician. Although many of their features overlap, they are two distinct conditions. KD is a febrile illness most commonly affecting children younger than five years. It manifests with prolonged fever and at least four of the following features: bilateral bulbar conjunctivitis, mucositis, diffuse maculopapular rash, extremity changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy of 1.5 cm or more in diameter. Patients with MIS-C may have many of the same manifestations but tend to have higher rates of gastrointestinal and neurocognitive symptoms and signs of shock on presentation. Both conditions are associated with cardiac sequelae, including coronary artery aneurysms, although children with MIS-C are at high risk of developing ventricular dysfunction and depressed cardiac output. Lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated troponin, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide are key laboratory findings of MIS-C that can help distinguish it from KD. The use of intravenous immune globulin is well established in KD and also appears to have a role in the treatment of MIS-C. Aspirin has been used in KD for an anti-inflammatory effect, and low-dose aspirin is recommended for MIS-C to reduce the risk of thrombosis. In addition to supportive care, patients with MIS-C may benefit from immunomodulatory medications, although data on this topic are evolving.",rash
34523756,Urticarial vasculitis: A potential signpost for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.,J Cutan Pathol,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare and serious complication of Sars-Cov-2 infection. Dermatologic manifestations are present in the majority of patients. Skin lesions found in children with MIS-C are classified into four categories: morbilliform, reticulated, scarlatiniform, and urticarial lesions. Clinicopathologic characterization within these categories is limited. Thus, we present a clear example of an urticarial lesion in the context of MIS-C with well-documented clinicopathologic phenomena. A previously healthy 16-year-old female presented with 3 weeks of an itchy, burning rash initially presenting on her right forearm (and lasting greater than 24 hours without migration) before spreading diffusely. She also reported fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, and vomiting of 4 weeks' duration. Physical examination revealed an edematous, maculopapular, nonblanching, erythematous rash covering the patient's upper extremities, abdomen, back, anterior thighs, and face. The patient tested positive for COVID-19. A low-grade leukocytoclastic vasculitis was noted along with intraluminal fibrin and rare microthrombi in vessels of the mid to deep dermis. The patient was diagnosed with MIS-C and urticarial vasculitis. She was treated with steroids and naproxen for subsequent MIS-C flares.

Like all medicines, vaccines are not devoid of risks and can in rare cases cause some various side effects. The objective of this case report is to highlight this unusual presentation of Henoch-Schonlein purpura following an anti-COVID-19 vaccination in a 62-year-old adult. The 62-year-old patient admitted to the emergency room for a petechial purpuric rash, sloping, occurring within hours, involving both legs and ascending. The clinical signs also included polyarthralgia and hematuria. Reported in the history the notion of an anti-COVID-19 vaccination 8 days prior to the onset of symptomatology. In the case of our patient, we retain the diagnosis of rheumatoid purpura based on the EULAR/PRINTO/PReS diagnostic criteria. Corticosteroid therapy (prednisone) was started, resulting to a rapid regression of clinical and laboratory symptoms, few days after the treatment. Patient was asymptomatic on subsequent visits. The low number of published cases of post-vaccine vasculitis does not question the safety of vaccines, but knowledge of such complications deserves to be known in order to avoid new immunizations that could have more serious consequences, and to avoid aggravating or reactivating a pre-existing vasculitis.",rash

34513435,Petechiae and Desquamation of Fingers Following Immunization With BTN162b2 Messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 Vaccine.,Cureus,"Since late 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed over three million people. More than 600,000 of these deaths have occurred in the United States alone. While advances in the treatment of COVID-19 have been made, the advent of highly effective vaccines against this coronavirus variant has given hope that the end of the pandemic may be near. Unfortunately, resistance towards vaccination remains a barrier to virus eradication both in the United States and globally. The driving factor for much of this opposition is the concern over potential adverse reactions from the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. In order to combat this, it is imperative that vaccine side effects and their corresponding clinical course are clearly described.

METHODS: The study was conducted in two phases with initial cross-sectional data collection with subsequent telemedical investigations of late skin manifestations including confirmed COVID-19 patients evaluated at Al-Nahdha Hospital and local health centers in Muscat from March 22 to June 2, 2020. RESULTS: The total number of patients included in the study was 374. Cutaneous manifestations were observed in 1.87% (n=7) of patients at presentation with an additional 1.6% (n=5) on follow-up. The types of skin reactions included maculopapular rash (n=6), urticaria (n=2), transient pruritic erythema (n=1), pruritic palmoplantar erythema (n=1), pustular eruption (n=1) and flare-up of atopic dermatitis (n=1). CONCLUSIONS: The low percentage of skin lesions is not contradicting previous data and it might just reflect under-reporting of skin rash in the context of the presence of more severe symptoms in our sample population. Skin lesions can still be utilized to treat patients as suspected cases until proven otherwise as it can be a silent clue in asymptomatic patients.",rash
34998242,Lack of evidence of significant homology of SARS-CoV-2 spike sequences to myocarditis-associated antigens.,EBioMedicine,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have proven to be highly safe and effective. Myocarditis is an adverse event associated with mRNA vaccination, especially in young male subjects. These events are rare and, in the majority of cases, resolve quickly. As myocarditis can be driven by autoimmune responses, we wanted to determine if the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigen encoded in the mRNA COVID vaccines had potential cross-reactivity with auto-antigens previously associated with myocarditis. METHODS: We performed a sequence identity comparison between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-derived peptides and myocarditis-associated antigens. We also performed a structural analysis of these antigens and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to identify potential discontinuous 3-D epitope similarities. FINDINGS: We found no significant enrichment in the frequency of spike-derived peptides similar to myocarditis-associated antigens as compared to several controls. INTERPRETATION: Our results do not support the notion that increased occurrence of myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2-spike vaccination is mediated by a cross-reactive adaptive immune response.",vaccine

Section II distinguishes justice from charity and argues that beneficiaries of unjust structures incur duties of justice when they are systematically advantaged at others expense. Section III gives a case-based argument describing three upstream structural injustices that systematically advantaged wealthy countries and disadvantaged poorer countries, contributing to global disparities of COVID-19 vaccines. Section IV examines more closely the duties of justice owed, including a duty to relinquish holdings, restitute victims, and restore relationships. Section V concludes that wealthy nations have a duty of justice to share COVID-19 vaccines with poor nations and to restore relationships damaged by injustice.

34997606,Iron dysregulation in COVID-19 and reciprocal evolution of SARS-CoV-2: Natura nihil frustra facit.,J Cell Biochem,"After more than a year of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infection rates with newer variants continue to devastate much of the world. Global healthcare systems are overwhelmed with high positive patient numbers. Silent hypoxia accompanied by rapid deterioration and some cases with septic shock is responsible for COVID-19 mortality in many hospitalized patients. There is an urgent need to further understand the relationships and interplay with human host components during pathogenesis and immune evasion strategies. Currently, acquired immunity through vaccination or prior infection usually provides sufficient protection against the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 except Omicron variant requiring recent booster. New strains have shown higher viral loads and greater transmissibility with more severe disease presentations. Notably, COVID-19 has a peculiar prognosis in severe patients with iron dysregulation and hypoxia which is still poorly understood. Studies have shown abnormally low serum iron levels in severe infection but a high iron overload in lung fibrotic tissue. Data from our in-silico structural analysis of the spike protein sequence along with host proteolysis processing suggests that the viral spike protein fragment mimics Hepcidin and is resistant to the major human proteases. This functional spike-derived peptide dubbed ""Covidin"" thus may be intricately involved with host ferroportin binding and internalization leading to dysregulated host iron metabolism. Here, we propose the possible role of this potentially allogenic mimetic hormone corresponding to severe COVID-19 immunopathology and illustrate that this molecular mimicry is responsible for a major pathway associated with severe disease status. Furthermore, through 3D molecular modeling and docking followed by MD simulation validation, we have unraveled the likely role of Covidin in iron dysregulation in COVID-19 patients. Our meta-analysis suggests the Hepcidin mimetic mechanism is highly conserved among its host range as well as among all new variants to date including Omicron. Extensive analysis of current mutations revealed that new variants are becoming alarmingly more resistant to selective human proteases associated with host defense.",vaccine

A major challenge for anatomy teachers is to replicate the experience of practical exposures. These exposures range from cadaveric dissection to demonstration of bones, museum specimens, and histology slides, where they will have interactive communication with students, and thus help in the enhancement of communication and clinical skills among them. In recent days, anatomy teachers throughout the globe started using various advanced technology to make the teaching-learning session more interesting. In pre-pandemic era, usage of such advancements in information and communication technology was a 'choice'. But pandemic has changed the situation drastically, what was a 'choice' earlier is now an 'obligation.' Presently although infection rate is low, vaccination rate is high, most of the medical schools re-opened for usual offline teaching, still body donation is all time low making the situation 'back to square one'.

34995958,"Mitigating Covid-19 in the face of emerging virus variants, breakthrough infections and vaccine hesitancy.",J Autoimmun,"The emergence and rapid global spread of the new Delta and, more recently, Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 pose a daunting public health emergency. Being an RNA virus, the Covid-19 virus is continuing to mutate, resulting in the emergence of new variants with high transmissibility, such as the recently discovered Omicron variant. In this paper, we consider the conditions that may facilitate viral mutations and the emergence of variants with the ability to evade immunity. Here, we have discussed the importance of vaccination with the currently available vaccines. These vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious disease, hospitalization, and death from Covid-19. However, the antibody response induced by these vaccines is short-lasting and there are reports of breakthrough infections. A stable and persistent interaction between T follicular helper cells and germinal center B cells is needed for robust B cell memory response. We discussed the potential reasons behind the breakthrough infections and underscored the importance of developing better second-generation vaccines that may not necessitate frequent booster immunizations and are preventive in nature. This may involve the development of multivalent vaccines and creating vaccines against other viral proteins including conserved proteins. Vaccine hesitancy remains a notable hurdle for implementing vaccination. Furthermore, we recommend different approaches to increase vaccine acceptance, which is a critical translational component of a successful vaccine strategy. These perspectives on overcoming the pandemic's current challenges provide strategies to contain SARS-CoV-2 globally.",vaccine

Different scientific activities have been emerged in this global scenario, including the development of innovative analytical tools to measure nucleic acid, antibodies, and antigens in the nasopharyngeal swab, serum, and saliva for prompt identification of COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the immune response to the vaccine. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva remains a challenge for the lack of sufficient sensitivity. To address this issue, we developed a novel paper-based immunoassay using magnetic beads to support the immunological chain and 96-well wax-printed paper plate as a platform for color visualization by using a smartphone combined with Spotxel free-charge app. To assess the reliability of the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva, untreated saliva was used as a specimen and the calibration curve demonstrated a dynamic range up to 10 mug/mL, with a detection limit equal to 0.1 mug/mL. The effectiveness of this sustainable analytical tool in saliva was evaluated by comparing the data with the nasopharyngeal swab specimens sampled by the same patients and tested with Real-Time PCR reference method, founding 100% of agreement, even in the case of high Cycle Threshold (CT) numbers (low viral load).

Given its potential to escape vaccine-induced humoral immunity, we measured the neutralization potency of sera from 88 mRNA-1273, 111 BNT162b, and 40 Ad26.COV2.S vaccine recipients against wild-type, Delta, and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. We included individuals that received their primary series recently (<3 months), distantly (6-12 months), or an additional ""booster"" dose, while accounting for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remarkably, neutralization of Omicron was undetectable in most vaccinees. However, individuals boosted with mRNA vaccines exhibited potent neutralization of Omicron, only 4-6-fold lower than wild type, suggesting enhanced cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibody responses. In addition, we find that Omicron pseudovirus infects more efficiently than other variants tested. Overall, this study highlights the importance of additional mRNA doses to broaden neutralizing antibody responses against highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants.",vaccine

METHODS: We used vaccination data from the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) linked to the 2011 Census and individual health records for subjects aged >/=40 years (n = 24 094 186). We estimated age-standardized vaccination rates, stratified by ethnic group and key sociodemographic characteristics, such as religious affiliation, deprivation, educational attainment, geography, living conditions, country of birth, language skills and health status. To understand the association of ethnicity with lower vaccination rates, we conducted a logistic regression model adjusting for differences in geographic, sociodemographic and health characteristics. ResultsAll ethnic groups had lower age-standardized rates of vaccination compared with the white British population, whose vaccination rate of at least one dose was 94% (95% CI: 94%-94%). Black communities had the lowest rates, with 75% (74-75%) of black African and 66% (66-67%) of black Caribbean individuals having received at least one dose. The drivers of these lower rates were partly explained by accounting for sociodemographic differences. However, modelled estimates showed significant differences remained for all minority ethnic groups, compared with white British individuals.

COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out for health care workers (HCWs) starting in January 2021. Objective: To assess the incidence density of reinfection among a cohort of HCWs and estimate the effectiveness of the inactivated whole virion vaccine BBV152 against reinfection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a retrospective cohort study among HCWs working at a tertiary care center in New Delhi, India. Exposures: Vaccination with 0, 1, or 2 doses of BBV152. Main Outcomes and Measures: The HCWs were categorized as fully vaccinated (with 2 doses and >/=15 days after the second dose), partially vaccinated (with 1 dose or 2 doses with <15 days after the second dose), or unvaccinated. The incidence density of COVID-19 reinfection per 100 person-years was computed, and events from March 3, 2020, to June 18, 2021, were included for analysis. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Estimated vaccine effectiveness (1 - adjusted HR) was reported. Results: Among 15244 HCWs who participated in the study, 4978 (32.7%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 36.6 (10.3) years, and 55.0% were male. The reinfection incidence density was 7.26 (95% CI: 6.09-8.66) per 100 person-years (124 HCWs [2.5%], total person follow-up period of 1696 person-years as time at risk). Fully vaccinated HCWs had lower risk of reinfection (HR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.08-0.23]), symptomatic reinfection (HR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.07-0.24]), and asymptomatic reinfection (HR, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.05-0.53]) compared with unvaccinated HCWs. Accordingly, among the 3 vaccine categories, reinfection was observed in 60 of 472 (12.7%) of unvaccinated (incidence density, 18.05 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 14.02-23.25), 39 of 356 (11.0%) of partially vaccinated (incidence density 15.62 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 11.42-21.38), and 17 of 1089 (1.6%) fully vaccinated (incidence density 2.18 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 1.35-3.51) HCWs. The estimated effectiveness of BBV152 against reinfection was 86% (95% CI, 77%-92%); symptomatic reinfection, 87% (95% CI, 76%-93%); and asymptomatic reinfection, 84% (95% CI, 47%-95%) among fully vaccinated HCWs. Partial vaccination was not associated with reduced risk of reinfection. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that BBV152 was associated with protection against both symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection in HCWs after a complete vaccination schedule, when the predominant circulating variant was B.1.617.2.",vaccine

Objective: To assess the immune humoral response to 2 or 3 doses of the BNT162b2 (BioNTech; Pfizer) vaccine in patients treated with anticancer agents. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted between February 1 and May 31, 2021. Adults treated with anticancer agents who received 2 or 3 doses of vaccine were included; of these, individuals with a weak humoral response 1 month after the second dose received a third injection. Interventions: Quantitative serologic testing of antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 was conducted before vaccination and during follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: Humoral response was evaluated with a threshold of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody levels at 1000 arbitrary units (AU)/mL to neutralize less-sensitive COVID-19 variants. Results: Among 163 patients (median [range] age, 66 [27-89] years, 86 men [53%]) with solid tumors who received 2 or 3 doses of vaccine, 122 individuals (75%) were treated with chemotherapy, 15 with immunotherapy (9%), and 26 with targeted therapies (16%). The proportions of patients with an anti-S immunoglobulin G titer greater than 1000 AU/mL were 15% (22 of 145) at the time of the second vaccination and 65% (92 of 142) 28 days after the second vaccination. Humoral response decreased 3 months after the second dose. Treatment type was associated with humoral response; in particular, time between vaccine and chemotherapy did not interfere with the humoral response. Among 36 patients receiving a third dose of vaccine, a serologic response greater than 1000 AU/mL occurred in 27 individuals (75%). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this cohort study appear to support the use of a third vaccine dose among patients with active cancer treatment for solid tumors.",vaccine

34994297,Discovery of compounds inhibiting SARS-COV-2 multi-targets.,J Biomol Struct Dyn,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic that has devastated the lives of millions. Researchers around the world are relentlessly working in hopes of finding a cure. Even though the virus shares similarities with reported SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at the genomic and proteomic level, efforts to repurpose already known drugs against SARS-CoV-2 have resulted ineffective. In this succinct review, we discuss the different potential targets in SARS-CoV-2 at both the genomic and proteomic levels. In addition, we analyze the compounds inhibiting individual target protein as well as multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2. ACE-2 receptor in humans has also been considered a target, keeping the role of the receptor in mind. The mechanism of action of these compounds has also been highlighted along with their clinical manifestation. Towards the end of the review, a brief note on the drugs currently in clinical trials and the current status of the vaccines are also examined. In conclusion, compounds targeting multiple targets of the virus hold the key in putting an end to the coronavirus malady.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",vaccine
34994256,Association Between the Effectiveness and Immunogenicity of Inactivated SARS-CoV2 Vaccine (CoronaVac) with the Presence of Hypertension among Health Care Workers.,Clin Exp Hypertens,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to observe the association between the presence of hypertension with Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among healthcare workers who received CoronaVac vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in Saiful Anwar General Hospital, Malang, Indonesia on 155 healthcare workers aged 18-59 years old who already received twice of the CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Science, Beijing, China) injection with 14-day intervals. Hypertension was diagnosed according to the 2020 International Society of Hypertension. Subjects were monitored for six months. The primary outcome was the rate of Covid-19 diagnosed by the pharyngeal swab for the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) examination. The secondary endpoints were: (1) severity of Covid-19 among infected participants; (2) rate of hospitalizations; and (3) anti-SRBD antibody levels measured by ECLIA. RESULTS: Among 155 participants, 18.7% of them were diagnosed with hypertension, and 31.0% had the desirable BP target according to the current guidelines. Subjects with hypertension, especially those with uncontrolled blood pressure, had a higher incidence of Covid-19 infection than subjects without hypertension. Subjects with symptomatic Covid-19 and hospitalized because of Covid-19 were higher in participants with hypertension. The anti-SRBD antibody levels were lower in the second month after CoronaVac vaccination in hypertensive subjects. In contrast, comparable anti-SRBD levels were seen from both groups at sixth months after vaccination. CONCLUSION: Hypertension was associated with lower vaccine effectiveness in healthcare workers. Subjects with hypertension had a higher risk of being infected with Covid-19 despite getting a complete dose of vaccination and lower antibody production.",vaccine
34992785,Association of COVID-19 antigenicity with the development of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody vasculitis.,Respirol Case Rep,"Inflammatory processes, such as an infection or drug reaction, can cause antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). Although quite rare, AAV may occur with SARS-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antigenic exposure, either from infection or immunization. We present two cases of AAV: one that developed after COVID-19 infection presenting as diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and another that developed shortly after vaccination, presenting as granulomatous pulmonary nodules. Both patients improved with supportive care and immunosuppressive therapies. This adverse event appears to be a very rare complication of COVID-19 infection or vaccination. Early diagnosis of AAV is important because immunosuppressive therapy may improve patient outcomes.",vaccine
34992726,The Way Ahead: Life After COVID-19.,Methodist Debakey Cardiovasc J,"Much has changed in the 2 years since the start of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The need for social distancing catalyzed the digitization of healthcare delivery and medical education-from telemedicine and virtual conferences to online residency/fellowship interviews. Vaccine development, particularly in the field of mRNA technology, led to widespread availability of safe and effective vaccines. With improved survival from acute infection, the healthcare system is dealing with the ever-growing cohort of patients with lingering symptoms. In addition, social media platforms have fueled a plethora of misinformation campaigns that have adversely affected prevention and control measures. In this review, we examine how COVID-19 has reshaped the healthcare system, and gauge its potential effects on life after the pandemic.",vaccine
34992610,A Single Dose SARS-CoV-2 Replicon RNA Vaccine Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses in Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Infected and Uninfected Pigtail Macaques.,Front Immunol,"The ongoing COVID-19 vaccine rollout is critical for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths worldwide. Unfortunately, massive disparities exist in getting vaccines to vulnerable populations, including people living with HIV. Preliminary studies indicate that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are safe and immunogenic in people living with HIV that are virally suppressed with potent antiretroviral therapy but may be less efficacious in immunocompromised individuals. This raises the concern that COVID-19 vaccines may be less effective in resource poor settings with limited access to antiretroviral therapy. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a single dose COVID-19 replicon RNA vaccine expressing Spike protein (A.1) from SARS-CoV-2 (repRNA-CoV2S) in immunocompromised, SIV infected and immune competent, naive pigtail macaques. Moderate vaccine-specific cellular Th1 T-cell responses and binding and neutralizing antibodies were induced by repRNA-CoV2S in SIV infected animals and naive animals. Furthermore, vaccine immunogenicity was elicited even among the animals with the highest SIV viral burden or lowest peripheral CD4 counts prior to immunization. This study provides evidence that a SARS-CoV-2 repRNA vaccine could be employed to induce strong immunity against COVID-19 in HIV infected and other immunocompromised individuals.",vaccine
34992449,Recent Advancements on COVID-19: A Comprehensive Review.,Int J Gen Med,"Over the last few decades, there have been several global outbreaks of severe respiratory infections. The causes of these outbreaks were coronaviruses that had infected birds, mammals and humans. The outbreaks predominantly caused respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract symptoms and other mild to very severe clinical signs. The current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a rapidly spreading illness affecting millions of people worldwide. Among the countries most affected by the disease are the United States of America (USA), India, Brazil, and Russia, with France recording the highest infection, morbidity, and mortality rates. Since early January 2021, thousands of articles have been published on COVID-19. Most of these articles were consistent with the reports on the mode of transmission, spread, duration, and severity of the sickness. Thus, this review comprehensively discusses the most critical aspects of COVID-19, including etiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical signs, transmission, pathological changes, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control, and vaccination.",vaccine
34992113,Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine receipt at two integrated healthcare systems in New York City: a cross-sectional study of healthcare workers.,BMJ Open,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine receipt among healthcare workers and the role of vaccine confidence in decisions to vaccinate, and to better understand concerns related to COVID-19 vaccination. DESIGN: Cross-sectional anonymous survey among front-line, support service and administrative healthcare workers. SETTING: Two large integrated healthcare systems (one private and one public) in New York City during the initial roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine. PARTICIPANTS: 1933 healthcare workers, including nurses, physicians, allied health professionals, environmental services staff, researchers and administrative staff. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was COVID-19 vaccine receipt during the initial roll-out of the vaccine among healthcare workers. RESULTS: Among 1933 healthcare workers who had been offered the vaccine, 81% had received the vaccine at the time of the survey. Receipt was lower among black (58%; OR: 0.14, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.2) compared with white (91%) healthcare workers, and higher among non-Hispanic (84%) compared with Hispanic (69%; OR: 2.37, 95% CI 1.8 to 3.1) healthcare workers. Among healthcare workers with concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety, 65% received the vaccine. Among healthcare workers who agreed with the statement that the vaccine is important to protect family members, 86% were vaccinated. Of those who disagreed, 25% received the vaccine (p<0.001). In a multivariable analysis, concern about being experimented on (OR: 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.6), concern about COVID-19 vaccine safety (OR: 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.55), lack of influenza vaccine receipt (OR: 0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.44), disagreeing that COVID-19 vaccination is important to protect others (OR: 0.37, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.52) and black race (OR: 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59) were independently associated with COVID-19 vaccine non-receipt. Over 70% of all healthcare workers responded that they had been approached for vaccine advice multiple times by family, community members and patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated high overall receipt among healthcare workers. Even among healthcare workers with concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety, side effects or being experimented on, over 50% received the vaccine. Attitudes around the importance of COVID-19 vaccination to protect others played a large role in healthcare workers' decisions to vaccinate. We observed striking inequities in COVID-19 vaccine receipt, particularly affecting black and Hispanic workers. Further research is urgently needed to address issues related to vaccine equity and uptake in the context of systemic racism and barriers to care. This is particularly important given the influence healthcare workers have in vaccine decision-making conversations in their communities.",vaccine
34992051,"Risk Factors for COVID-19 in College Students Identified by Physical, Mental, and Social Health Reported During the Fall 2020 Semester: An Observational Study Using the Roadmap app and Fitbit Wearable Sensors.",JMIR Ment Health,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic triggered a seismic shift in education, to online learning. With nearly 20 million students enrolled in colleges across the U.S., the long-simmering mental health crisis in college students was likely further exacerbated by the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study leveraged mobile health (mHealth) technology and sought to: i) characterize self-reported outcomes of physical, mental, and social health by COVID-19 status; ii) assess physical activity through consumer-grade wearable sensors (Fitbit(R)); and iii) identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 positivity in a population of college students prior to release of the vaccine. METHODS: Detailed methods were previously published in JMIR Res Protocols (Cislo et al). After completing a baseline assessment (i.e., Time 0 [T0]) of demographics, mental, and social health constructs through the Roadmap 2.0 app, participants were instructed to use the app freely, to wear the Fitbit(R), and complete subsequent assessments at T1, T2 and T3, followed by a COVID-19 assessment of history and timing of COVID-19 testing and diagnosis (T4: ~14 days after T3). Continuous measures were described using means (M) and standard deviations (SD), while categorical measures were summarized using frequencies and proportions. Formal comparisons were made based on COVID-19 status. The multivariate model was determined by entering all statistically significant variables (P<.05) in univariable associations at once and then removing one variable at a time by backward selection until the optimal model was obtained. RESULTS: During the fall 2020 semester, 1,997 participants consented, enrolled, and met criteria for data analyses. There was a high prevalence of anxiety, as assessed by the State Trait Anxiety Index (STAI), with moderate and severe levels in N=465 (24%) and N=970 (49%) students, respectively. Approximately, one-third of students reported having a mental health disorder (N=656, 33%). The average daily steps recorded in this student population was approximately 6500 (M=6474, SD=3371). Neither reported mental health nor step count were significant based on COVID-19 status (P=.52). Our analyses revealed significant associations of COVID-positivity with use of marijuana and alcohol (P =.020 and .046, respectively) and lower belief in public health measures (P=.003). In addition, graduate students were less likely and those with >/=20 roommates were more likely to report a COVID-19 diagnosis (P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: Mental health problems were common in this student population. Several factors, including substance use, were associated with risk of COVID-19. These data highlight important areas for further attention, such as prioritizing innovative strategies that address health and well-being, considering the potential long-term effects of COVID-19 on college students.

34991982,An update on drugs with therapeutic potential for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) treatment.,Drug Resist Updat,"The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century with more than 257 million cases and over 5.17 million deaths reported worldwide (as of November 23, 2021. Various agents were initially proclaimed to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are all examples of therapeutic agents, whose efficacy against COVID-19 was later disproved. Meanwhile, concentrated efforts of researchers and clinicians worldwide have led to the identification of novel therapeutic options to control the disease including PAXLOVID (PF-07321332). Although COVID-19 cases are currently treated using a comprehensive approach of anticoagulants, oxygen, and antibiotics, the novel Pfizer agent PAXLOVID (PF-07321332), an investigational COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate, significantly reduced hospitalization time and death rates, based on an interim analysis of the phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness. The scheduled interim analysis demonstrated an 89 % reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset (primary endpoint). However, there still exists a great need for the development of additional treatments, as the recommended therapeutic options are insufficient in many cases. Thus far, mRNA and vector vaccines appear to be the most effective modalities to control the pandemic. In the current review, we provide an update on the progress that has been made since April 2020 in clinical trials concerning the effectiveness of therapies available to combat COVID-19. We focus on currently recommended therapeutic agents, including steroids, various monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, baricitinib, anticoagulants and PAXLOVID summarizing the latest original studies and meta-analyses. Moreover, we aim to discuss other currently and previously studied agents targeting COVID-19 that either show no or only limited therapeutic activity. The results of recent studies report that hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma demonstrate no efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lastly, we summarize the studies on various drugs with incoherent or insufficient data concerning their effectiveness, such as amantadine, ivermectin, or niclosamide.",vaccine

METHODS: We analyzed prospectively tracked menstrual cycle data using the application ""Natural Cycles."" We included U.S. residents aged 18-45 years with normal cycle lengths (24-38 days) for three consecutive cycles before the first vaccine dose followed by vaccine-dose cycles (cycles 4-6) or, if unvaccinated, six cycles over a similar time period. We calculated the mean within-individual change in cycle and menses length (three prevaccine cycles vs first- and second-dose cycles in the vaccinated cohort, and the first three cycles vs cycles four and five in the unvaccinated cohort). We used mixed-effects models to estimate the adjusted difference in change in cycle and menses length between the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. RESULTS: We included 3,959 individuals (vaccinated 2,403; unvaccinated 1,556). Most of the vaccinated cohort received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (55%) (Moderna 35%, Johnson & Johnson/Janssen 7%). Overall, COVID-19 vaccine was associated with a less than 1-day change in cycle length for both vaccine-dose cycles compared with prevaccine cycles (first dose 0.71 day-increase, 98.75% CI 0.47-0.94; second dose 0.91, 98.75% CI 0.63-1.19); unvaccinated individuals saw no significant change compared with three baseline cycles (cycle four 0.07, 98.75% CI -0.22 to 0.35; cycle five 0.12, 98.75% CI -0.15 to 0.39). In adjusted models, the difference in change in cycle length between the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts was less than 1 day for both doses (difference in change: first dose 0.64 days, 98.75% CI 0.27-1.01; second dose 0.79 days, 98.75% CI 0.40-1.18). Change in menses length was not associated with vaccination. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination is associated with a small change in cycle length but not menses length.",vaccine
34990709,Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and immune response among individuals in clinical risk groups.,J Infect,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines approved in the UK are highly effective in general population cohorts, however, data on effectiveness among individuals with clinical conditions that place them at increased risk of severe disease are limited. METHODS: We used GP electronic health record data, sentinel virology swabbing and antibody testing within a cohort of 712 general practices across England to estimate vaccine antibody response and vaccine effectiveness against medically attended COVID-19 among individuals in clinical risk groups using cohort and test-negative case control designs. FINDINGS: There was no reduction in S-antibody positivity in most clinical risk groups, however reduced S-antibody positivity and response was significant in the immunosuppressed group. Reduced vaccine effectiveness against clinical disease was also noted in the immunosuppressed group; after a second dose, effectiveness was moderate (Pfizer: 59.6%, 95%CI 18.0-80.1%; AstraZeneca 60.0%, 95%CI -63.6-90.2%). INTERPRETATION: In most clinical risk groups, immune response to primary vaccination was maintained and high levels of vaccine effectiveness were seen. Reduced antibody response and vaccine effectiveness were seen after 1 dose of vaccine among a broad immunosuppressed group, and second dose vaccine effectiveness was moderate. These findings support maximising coverage in immunosuppressed individuals and the policy of prioritisation of this group for third doses.",vaccine
34990653,Interferon Control of Human Coronavirus Infection and Viral Evasion: Mechanistic Insights and Implications for Antiviral Drug and Vaccine Development.,J Mol Biol,"Recognition of viral infections by various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) activates an inflammatory cytokine response that inhibits viral replication and orchestrates the activation of adaptive immune responses to control the viral infection. The broadly active innate immune response puts a strong selective pressure on viruses and drives the selection of variants with increased capabilities to subvert the induction and function of antiviral cytokines. This revolutionary process dynamically shapes the host ranges, cell tropism and pathogenesis of viruses. Recent studies on the innate immune responses to the infection of human coronaviruses (HCoV), particularly SARS-CoV-2, revealed that HCoV infections can be sensed by endosomal toll-like receptors and/or cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptors in various cell types. However, the profiles of inflammatory cytokines and transcriptome response induced by a specific HCoV are usually cell type specific and determined by the virus-specific mechanisms of subverting the induction and function of interferons and inflammatory cytokines as well as the genetic trait of the host genes of innate immune pathways. We review herein the recent literatures on the innate immune responses and their roles in the pathogenesis of HCoV infections with emphasis on the pathobiological roles and therapeutic effects of type I interferons in HCoV infections and their antiviral mechanisms. The knowledge on the mechanism of innate immune control of HCoV infections and viral evasions should facilitate the development of therapeutics for induction of immune resolution of HCoV infections and vaccines for efficient control of COVID-19 pandemics and other HCoV infections.",vaccine
34990593,Qualitative and Quantitative Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies from Dried Blood Spots.,Clin Biochem,"INTRODUCTION: Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling is a minimally invasive method for specimen collection with potential multifaceted uses, particularly for serosurveillance of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we assessed DBS as a potential specimen type for assessing IgG and total (including IgG and IgM) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated and naturally infected patients. METHODS: Six candidate buffers were assessed for eluting blood from DBS cards. The study utilized one hundred and five paired plasma specimens and DBS specimens from prospectively collected SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals, remnants from those with PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, or remnants from those without history of infection or vaccination. All specimens were tested with the Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total assay (COV2T) or IgG assay (sCOVG). RESULTS: The lowest backgrounds were observed with water and PBS, and water was used for elution. Relative to plasma samples, DBS samples had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 94.4% (95% CI: 94.9-100%) for COV2T and 79.2 (68.4-87.0) for sCOVG using the manufacturer's cutoff. The NPA was 100 % (87.1-100.0 and 85.13-100) for both assays. Dilution studies revealed 100% (95% CI: 90.8-100%) qualitative agreement between specimen types on the COV2T assay and 98.0% (88.0-99.9%) with the sCOVG using study defined cutoffs. CONCLUSION: DBS specimens demonstrated high PPA and NPA relative to plasma for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing. Our data support feasibility of DBS sampling for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing.",vaccine

Concerns among pregnant women regarding vaccine safety are a persistent barrier to vaccine acceptance during pregnancy. Previous studies of maternal COVID-19 vaccination and birth outcomes have been limited by small sample size (2) or lack of an unvaccinated comparison group (3). In this retrospective cohort study of live births from eight Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) health care organizations, risks for preterm birth (<37 weeks' gestation) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) at birth (birthweight <10th percentile for gestational age) after COVID-19 vaccination (receipt of >/=1 COVID-19 vaccine doses) during pregnancy were evaluated. Risks for preterm and SGA at birth among vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant women were compared, accounting for time-dependent vaccine exposures and propensity to be vaccinated. Single-gestation pregnancies with estimated start or last menstrual period during May 17-October 24, 2020, were eligible for inclusion. Among 46,079 pregnant women with live births and gestational age available, 10,064 (21.8%) received >/=1 COVID-19 vaccine doses during pregnancy and during December 15, 2020-July 22, 2021; nearly all (9,892; 98.3%) were vaccinated during the second or third trimester. COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with preterm birth (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.82-1.01). Among 40,627 live births with birthweight available, COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy was not associated with SGA at birth (aHR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.87-1.03). Results consistently showed no increased risk when stratified by mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose, or by second or third trimester vaccination, compared with risk among unvaccinated pregnant women. Because of the small number of first-trimester exposures, aHRs for first-trimester vaccination could not be calculated. These data add to the evidence supporting the safety of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. To reduce the risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness, CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccination for women who are pregnant, recently pregnant (including those who are lactating), who are trying to become pregnant now, or who might become pregnant in the future (4).",vaccine
34990408,"Aerosol delivery, but not intramuscular injection, of adenovirus-vectored tuberculosis vaccine induces respiratory-mucosal immunity in humans.",JCI Insight,"BACKGROUND: Adenoviral (Ad)-vectored vaccines are typically administered via intramuscular injection to humans, incapable of inducing respiratory mucosal immunity. However, aerosol delivery of Ad-vectored vaccines remains poorly characterized and its ability to induce mucosal immunity in humans is unknown. This phase 1b trial was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of human serotype-5 Ad-vectored tuberculosis (TB) vaccine (AdHu5Ag85A) delivered to humans via inhaled aerosol or intramuscular injection. METHODS: 31 healthy, previously BCG-vaccinated adults were enrolled. AdHu5Ag85A was administered by single-dose aerosol using Aeroneb(R) Solo Nebulizer or by intramuscular (IM) injection. The study consisted of the low dose (LD) aerosol, high dose (HD) aerosol and IM groups. The adverse events were assessed at various times post-vaccination. Immunogenicity data were collected from the peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples at baseline and select timepoints post-vaccination. RESULTS: The nebulized aerosol droplets were <5.39microm in size. Both LD and HD of AdHu5Ag85A administered by aerosol inhalation and IM injection were safe and well-tolerated. Both aerosol doses, particularly LD, but not IM, vaccination markedly induced airway tissue-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells of polyfunctionality. While as expected, IM vaccination induced Ag85A-specific T cell responses in the blood, the LD aerosol vaccination also elicited such T cells in the blood. Furthermore, the LD aerosol vaccination induced persisting transcriptional changes in alveolar macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled aerosol delivery of Ad-vectored vaccine is a safe and superior way to elicit respiratory mucosal immunity. This study warrants further development of aerosol vaccine strategies against respiratory pathogens including TB and COVID-19.

34990107,Column Agglutination Assay Using Polystyrene Microbeads for Rapid Detection of Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,"Rapid serology platforms are essential in disease pandemics for a variety of applications, including epidemiological surveillance, contact tracing, vaccination monitoring, and primary diagnosis in resource-limited areas. Laboratory-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platforms are inherently multistep processes that require trained personnel and are of relatively limited throughput. As an alternative, agglutination-based systems have been developed; however, they rely on donor red blood cells and are not yet available for high-throughput screening. Column agglutination tests are a mainstay of pretransfusion blood typing and can be performed at a range of scales, ranging from manual through to fully automated testing. Here, we describe a column agglutination test using colored microbeads coated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that agglutinates when incubated with serum samples collected from patients recently infected with SARS-CoV-2. After confirming specific agglutination, we optimized centrifugal force and time to distinguish samples from uninfected vs SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and then showed concordant results against ELISA for 22 clinical samples, and also a set of serial bleeds from one donor at days 6-10 postinfection. Our study demonstrates the use of a simple, scalable, and rapid diagnostic platform that can be tailored to detect antibodies raised against SARS-CoV-2 and can be easily integrated with established laboratory frameworks worldwide.",vaccine

We aimed to investigate the humoral responses of our peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients to the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. METHODS: Humoral immune responses of 23 PD patients who received two doses of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were investigated with a commercial test that measures IgG antibodies towards receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Seropositivity rates, antibody titers, and ESRD related clinical data were compared with 51 hemodialysis (HD) patients and 29 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Seropositivity of PD patients with the inactivated vaccine was 95.6%. Both the rate of seropositivity and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels in PD patients were not different from the healthy controls (p = 0.85 and 0.19, respectively). While seropositivity rates were not different for PD or HD patients (p = 0.09), the magnitude of humoral responses was significantly higher in PD patients (p = 0.0001). There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. In the 3-months clinical follow-up, none of the patients experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: Two doses of the inactivated vaccine generate adequate humoral immune response in PD patients without any serious adverse events.",vaccine

34989330,Age-associated SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection and changes in immune response in mouse model.,Emerg Microbes Infect,"ABSTRACTOlder individuals are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcome but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. In addition, how age modulates SARS-CoV-2 re-infection and vaccine breakthrough infections remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated age-associated SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, immune responses, and the occurrence of re-infection and vaccine breakthrough infection utilizing a wild type C57BL/6N mouse model. We demonstrated that interferon and adaptive antibody response upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge are significantly impaired in aged mice in comparison to young mice, which results in more effective virus replication and severe disease manifestations in the respiratory tract. Aged mice also showed increased susceptibility to re-infection due to insufficient immune protection acquired during primary infection. Importantly, two-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccination conferred limited adaptive immune response among the aged mice which rendered them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our findings call for tailored and optimized treatment and prevention strategies against SARS-CoV-2 among the older individuals.",vaccine
34989238,"Omicron Variant (B.1.1.529): Infectivity, Vaccine Breakthrough, and Antibody Resistance.",J Chem Inf Model,"The latest severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant Omicron (B.1.1.529) has ushered panic responses around the world due to its contagious and vaccine escape mutations. The essential infectivity and antibody resistance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant are determined by its mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, a complete experimental evaluation of Omicron might take weeks or even months. Here, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Omicron's infectivity, vaccine breakthrough, and antibody resistance. An artificial intelligence (AI) model, which has been trained with tens of thousands of experimental data and extensively validated by experimental results on SARS-CoV-2, reveals that Omicron may be over 10 times more contagious than the original virus or about 2.8 times as infectious as the Delta variant. On the basis of 185 three-dimensional (3D) structures of antibody-RBD complexes, we unveil that Omicron may have an 88% likelihood to escape current vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from Eli Lilly may be seriously compromised. Omicron may also diminish the efficacy of mAbs from AstraZeneca, Regeneron mAb cocktail, Celltrion, and Rockefeller University. However, its impacts on GlaxoSmithKline's sotrovimab appear to be mild. Our work calls for new strategies to develop the next generation mutation-proof SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antibodies.",vaccine
34989097,Response to and outcomes of the Pfizer BNT162B2 vaccine in hemodialysis patients-A prospective observational study.,Hemodial Int,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 infection is associated with high mortality among hemodialysis patients. Standard vaccine response is generally lower among these patients. The adequate antibody titer response and the outcome of COVID-19 vaccine responders versus non-responders are unknown. METHODS: Hemodialysis patients on maintenance hemodialysis who have received two doses of Pfizer BNT162B2 vaccine were studied. Antibody response was tested after 14 days of the second dose. LIAISON SARS-CoV2 S1/S2 IgG test by DiaSorin (Italy) was used to assess antibody response. Patients were followed between 3 and 7 months after vaccination for COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and death related to COVID-19. FINDINGS: A total of 138 patients received two doses of Pfizer BNT162B2 vaccine. One hundred and twenty-seven patients had adequate response to the vaccine with IgG level >/= 15 AU/ml versus 11 patients had poor response with IgG level </= 15 AU/ml. The response was 92% (127/138). Patient with history of prior COVID-19 infection had higher antibody titer mean of 339 +/- 113 versus 157 +/- 140 for patient with no prior history of COVID-19. Seven patients in both groups had COVID-19 infection post vaccine. Among the responders, five patients had COIVD-19 infection and two were hospitalized. These two patients had lower antibody titer of 23.9 and 75.2 AU/ml. In comparison, three patients who were not hospitalized had higher antibody titer 96.3, 118, and 319 AU/ml, respectively. In the non-responders one patient was hospitalized and one death occurred with rate of infection of 18%. DISCUSSION: Seropositive patients with low antibody titer might be associated with worse outcome among responders. The ideal antibody titer level among dialysis patient is not known. Also, prior COVID-19 infection is associated with higher response to vaccine with higher antibody titer. All non-responders did not have prior COVID-19 infection. More research is required to further evaluated protective antibody titer.",vaccine
34988998,Neutralizing potency of COVID-19 vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant.,J Med Virol,"The recent emergence of a new variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) called Omicron (B.1.1.529) has raised paramount concerns in scientific and medical communities due to the presence of several mutations in the spike protein, many of which are located within the receptor binding domain (RBD).(1) Some of these mutations were found to have a substantial influence on host cells receptor and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies binding,(2) which may then impact infectivity and neutralizing antibodies escape, thus potentially magnifying the risk of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine breakthrough. We have hence carried out a scientific literature search, aimed at summarizing the currently published evidence on Omicron variant neutralizing properties of serum or plasma collected from recipients of COVID-19 vaccines.",vaccine
34988942,Impact of tozinameran (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine on kidney transplant and chronic dialysis patients: 3-5 months follow-up.,J Nephrol,"BACKGROUND: Determining the humoral immunogenicity of tozinameran (BNT162b2) in patients requiring chronic renal replacement therapy, and its impact on COVID-19 morbidity several months after vaccination, may guide risk assessment and changes in vaccination policy. METHODS: In a prospective post-vaccination cohort study with up to 5 months follow-up we studied outpatient dialysis and kidney transplant patients and respective healthcare teams. Outcomes were anti S1/S2 antibody responses to vaccine or infection, and infection rate during follow-up. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-five dialysis patients (40% women, 65 +/- 15 years), 252 kidney transplant patients (33% women, 54 +/- 14 years) and 71 controls (65% women, 44 +/- 14 years) were followed. Three months or longer after vaccination we detected anti S1/S2 IgG antibodies in 79% of dialysis patients, 42% of transplant recipients and 100% of controls, whereas respective rates after infection were 94%, 69% and 100%. Predictors of non-response were older age, diabetes, history of cancer, lower lymphocyte count and lower vitamin-D levels. Factors associated with lower antibody levels in dialysis patients were modality (hemodialysis vs peritoneal) and high serum ferritin levels. In transplant patients, hypertension and higher calcineurin or mTOR inhibitor drug levels were linked with lower antibody response. Vaccination was associated with fewer subsequent infections (HR 0.23, p < 0.05). Moreover, higher antibody levels (particularly above 59 AU/ml) were associated with fewer events, with a HR 0.41 for each unit increased in log10titer (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis patients, and more strikingly kidney transplant recipients, mounted reduced antibody response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Lesser humoral response was associated with more infections. Measures to identify and protect non-responsive patients are required.",vaccine
34988925,Practice report: an Alberta Metis model for COVID-19 vaccine delivery.,Can J Public Health,"SETTING: In January 2021, the COVID-19 vaccine became available to First Nations, Metis, and Inuit (FNMI) over the age of 65 living in First Nations communities or Metis settlements in Alberta. In March, vaccine eligibility in Alberta expanded to include FNMI peoples of younger ages and in urban settings. The Metis Nation of Alberta (MNA) and other Indigenous organizations recognized that FNMI populations might be better served by tailored vaccine programs. INTERVENTION: The MNA is the government for the Metis people in Alberta. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the MNA has supported its citizens, through financial and mental wellness support, access to personal protective equipment, and messaging regarding public health orders. When vaccines became available, culturally appropriate virtual vaccine information sessions were provided. In March 2021, the MNA delivered the first Metis-led COVID-19 vaccination clinic. Unique to the clinic's success was the location, online booking process, and community presence. The clinic focused on cultural safety, including the availability of Indigenous health professionals to community members, and cultural reference points throughout the clinic. OUTCOMES: In the first MNA clinic, over 1300 people were vaccinated. Visitors shared appreciation for the culturally specific aspects of the clinic, which contributed to increased safety and comfort. IMPLICATIONS: Based on the success of the first Metis-led vaccination clinic, similar services in communities with high numbers of Metis people have been approved. This innovative practice initiative could provide a model of COVID-19 vaccine service delivery that could be used to meet the needs of Metis citizens in other jurisdictions in Canada.",vaccine
34988889,Neutralizing antibody: a savior in the Covid-19 disease.,Mol Biol Rep,"Coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. The pandemic has led to a devastating loss of life. It has shown us how infectious diseases can cause human existence at stake, and community health is important. The spike protein is the most immunogenic component of the virus. Most vaccine development strategies have focused on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein because it is the most specific target site that recognizes and interacts with human lung cells. Neutralizing antibodies are generated by the humoral immune system and reduce the viral load by binding to spike protein components. Neutralizing antibodies are the proteins secreted by plasma cells and serve as an important part of the defense mechanism. In the recent Covid-19 infection, neutralizing antibodies can be utilized for both diagnostic such as immune surveillance and therapeutic tools such as plasma therapy. So far, many monoclonal antibodies are in the clinical trial phase, and few of them are already in use. In this review, we have discussed details about neutralizing antibodies and their role in combating Covid-19 disease.",vaccine
34988883,Abrupt worsening of occult IgA nephropathy after the first dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.,CEN Case Rep,"Here, we report a case of abrupt onset of gross hematuria and nephrotic range proteinuria after the first dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination, which led to a diagnosis of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). A Japanese woman in their forties with a significant medical history of occult blood by urine dipstick test (over the past 3 years) presented with fever, chills, shivering, marked thrombocytopenia, and gross hematuria 9 days after the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer) against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) was first suspected as the cause of the severe thrombocytopenia, TMA was clinically excluded after two sessions of plasma exchange were performed. Renal biopsy was performed as the patient's platelet count improved. We made a diagnosis of acute worsening IgAN, triggered by the first dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In this case, we speculated that vaccine-induced immune activation may be involved in the exacerbation of occult IgAN, leading to the definite diagnosis. We should pay more attention to the development/worsening of clinically significant kidney disease after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination not only in those with known glomerular disease but also in those with only mild urinary abnormality.",vaccine
34988252,"Minimum Manufacturing Costs, National Prices, and Estimated Global Availability of New Repurposed Therapies for Coronavirus Disease 2019.",Open Forum Infect Dis,"Background: Currently, only dexamethasone, tocilizumab, and sarilumab have conclusively been shown to reduce mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Safe and effective treatments will need to be both affordable and widely available globally to be used alongside vaccination programs. This analysis will estimate and compare potential generic minimum costs of a selection of approved COVID-19 drug candidates with available international list prices. Methods: We searched for repurposed drugs that have been approved by at least one of the World Health Organization, US Food and Drug Administration, or the United Kingdom National Institute of Health and Care Excellence organizations or at least given emergency use authorization or recommended for off-label prescription. Drug prices were searched for dexamethasone, budesonide, baricitinib, tocilizumab, casirivimab, and imdevimab, and sarilumab, using active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) data extracted from global shipping records. This was compared with national pricing data from a range of low-, medium-, and high-income countries. Annual API export volumes from India were used to estimate the current availability of each drug. Results: Repurposed therapies can be generically manufactured for some treatments at very low per-course costs, ranging from US $2.58 for intravenous (IV) dexamethasone (or US $0.19 orally) and US $4.34 for inhaled budesonide. No export price data were available for baricitinib, tocilizumab, casirivimab, and imdevimab, or sarilumab, but courses of these treatments have higher prices, ranging from US $6.67 for baricitinib to US $875.5 for sarilumab. When comparing international list prices, we found wide variations between countries. Conclusions: Successful management of COVID-19 will require equitable access to treatment for all populations, not just those able to pay high prices. Dexamethasone and budesonide are widely available and affordable, whereas monoclonal antibodies and IV treatment courses are more expensive.",vaccine
34987936,Epidemiology and Risk Factors of COVID-19-Related Mortality.,Cureus,"Introduction During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in India, several characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, based on demographics, mortality predictors, and presence of comorbidities, were found to be associated with poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to identify such epidemiological and clinical characteristics among the patients admitted at a tertiary-care center in India that may have predisposed them to COVID-19-related mortality. Methods This retrospective observational study conducted at the Department of Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, in May 2021 included 141 COVID-19 confirmed patients. The medical history, demographic characteristics, comorbidities, clinical findings, and laboratory data of each patient were obtained. The data were analyzed to identify significant clinical and laboratory parameters that led to the adverse final outcomes. Results Hypertension was the most common comorbidity and the presence of diabetes with hypertension led to poorer final outcomes. Lower oxygen saturation and requirement of oxygen supplementation at admission along with worse prognostic scores during admission led to poorer outcomes. Twenty-seven patients needed non-invasive ventilation (NIV) during the hospital course, and all ultimately landed up among the 56 patients who were managed on invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Multivariate logistic regression analysis performed identified COVID-19 severity at admission, co-existence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, and serum creatinine greater than 1.2 mg/dL to be associated with higher COVID-19 mortality. Conclusion COVID-19 patients having the co-existence of diabetes and hypertension constitute a high-risk group and may be targeted by prompt vaccination strategies. The presence of severe disease along with a need for oxygen therapy and other intensive care interventions ultimately led to unfavorable outcomes.",vaccine
34987889,First Reported Case of Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome After a SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine.,Cureus,"This is the first report of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) as a complication of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. A 38-year-old female developed visual impairment due to scotomas and thunderclap headache 18 days after the second shot of the Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Multimodal cerebral MRI revealed an acute cortical ischemic lesion in the territory of the right posterior cerebral artery (PCA) on T2-weighted images, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and absence of the PCA on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). RCVS was diagnosed as the cause of the ischemic lesion. RCVS partially resolved upon nimodipine and anti-seizure drugs within nine days. In conclusion, this case shows that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can be followed by RCVS, manifesting as headache, stroke, and epileptiform discharges, and responding favorably to nimodipine.",vaccine
34987555,COVID-19 and inequities in the Americas: lessons learned and implications for essential health services.,Rev Panam Salud Publica,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated social, economic, and health-related disparities, which disproportionately affect persons living in conditions of vulnerability. Such populations include ethnic groups who face discrimination and experience barriers to accessing comprehensive health care. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these health disparities, and disruptions of essential health services have further widened the gaps in access to health care. Noncommunicable diseases are more prevalent among groups most impacted by poor social determinants of health and have been associated with an increased likelihood of severe COVID-19 disease and higher mortality. Disruptions in the provision of essential health services for noncommunicable diseases, mental health, communicable diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, and maternal and child health services (including sexual and reproductive health), are projected to also increase poor health outcomes. Other challenges have been an increased frequency of interpersonal violence and food insecurity. Countries in the Americas have responded to the disruptions caused by the pandemic by means of health service delivery through telemedicine and other digital solutions and stepping up social service support interventions. As vaccinations for COVID-19 create the opportunity to overcome the pandemic, countries must strengthen primary health care and essential health services with a view to ensuring equity, if the region is to achieve universal health coverage in fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals.",vaccine
34987509,An Intranasal OMV-Based Vaccine Induces High Mucosal and Systemic Protecting Immunity Against a SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,Front Immunol,"The development of more effective, accessible, and easy to administer COVID-19 vaccines next to the currently marketed mRNA, viral vector, and whole inactivated virus vaccines is essential to curtailing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A major concern is reduced vaccine-induced immune protection to emerging variants, and therefore booster vaccinations to broaden and strengthen the immune response might be required. Currently, all registered COVID-19 vaccines and the majority of COVID-19 vaccines in development are intramuscularly administered, targeting the induction of systemic immunity. Intranasal vaccines have the capacity to induce local mucosal immunity as well, thereby targeting the primary route of viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 with the potential of blocking transmission. Furthermore, intranasal vaccines offer greater practicality in terms of cost and ease of administration. Currently, only eight out of 112 vaccines in clinical development are administered intranasally. We developed an intranasal COVID-19 subunit vaccine, based on a recombinant, six-proline-stabilized, D614G spike protein (mC-Spike) of SARS-CoV-2 linked via the LPS-binding peptide sequence mCramp (mC) to outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from Neisseria meningitidis. The spike protein was produced in CHO cells, and after linking to the OMVs, the OMV-mC-Spike vaccine was administered to mice and Syrian hamsters via intranasal or intramuscular prime-boost vaccinations. In all animals that received OMV-mC-Spike, serum-neutralizing antibodies were induced upon vaccination. Importantly, high levels of spike-binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) and A (IgA) antibodies in the nose and lungs were only detected in intranasally vaccinated animals, whereas intramuscular vaccination only induced an IgG response in the serum. Two weeks after their second vaccination, hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs compared to the control groups vaccinated with OMV or spike alone. Histopathology showed no lesions in lungs 7 days after challenge in OMV-mC-Spike-vaccinated hamsters, whereas the control groups did show pathological lesions in the lung. The OMV-mC-Spike candidate vaccine data are very promising and support further development of this novel non-replicating, needle-free, subunit vaccine concept for clinical testing.",vaccine
34987505,Detection of Antibody Responses Against SARS-CoV-2 in Plasma and Saliva From Vaccinated and Infected Individuals.,Front Immunol,"Antibodies (Abs) are essential for the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2, and all the vaccines developed so far have been designed to induce Abs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Many studies have examined Ab responses in the blood from vaccinated and infected individuals. However, since SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, it is also critical to understand the mucosal Ab responses at the sites of initial virus exposure. Here, we examined plasma versus saliva Ab responses in vaccinated and convalescent patients. Although saliva levels were significantly lower, a strong correlation was observed between plasma and saliva total Ig levels against all SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested. Virus-specific IgG1 responses predominated in both saliva and plasma, while a lower prevalence of IgM and IgA1 Abs was observed in saliva. Antiviral activities of plasma Abs were also studied. Neutralization titers against the initial WA1 (D614G), B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) strains were similar but lower against the B.1.351 (beta) strain. Spike-specific antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) activities were also detected and the levels correlated with spike-binding Ig titers. Interestingly, while neutralization and ADCP potencies of vaccinated and convalescent groups were comparable, enhanced complement deposition to spike-specific Abs was noted in vaccinated versus convalescent groups and corresponded with higher levels of IgG1 plus IgG3 among the vaccinated individuals. Altogether, this study demonstrates the detection of Ab responses after vaccination or infection in plasma and saliva that correlate significantly, although Ig isotypic differences were noted. The induced plasma Abs displayed Fab-mediated and Fc-dependent functions with comparable neutralization and ADCP potencies, but a greater capacity to activate complement was elicited upon vaccination.",vaccine
34987300,COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake and Hesitancy Among Current Tobacco Users.,Tob Use Insights,"Novel mRNA vaccines have been developed and were first distributed to high-risk individuals (including smokers) in the United States starting in December 2020 to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Over one-half of the U.S. adult population has received at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but many others have reported hesitation about becoming vaccinated. We examined COVID-19 vaccine uptake and hesitancy from a convenience sample of Pennsylvanian adult smokers in April 2021, approximately 3 months after tobacco users were eligible to receive vaccination in the state. Participants (n = 231) were 23.4% male, 90.5% white, and had a mean age of 48.1 (SD = 11.9) years. All participants were current tobacco users, with the majority reporting current cigarette smoking (90.9%) with an average of 16 (SD = 8.1) cigarettes smoked per day. Nearly 60% (n = 137) reported receiving at least 1 dose of the vaccine and of those who did not (n = 94), 84% (n = 79) said they were somewhat or very unlikely to get a vaccine. Those who were unvaccinated were more likely to not consume news about COVID-19 (chi-square P-value < .01) and less likely to believe government news sources as reliable information for COVID-19 (chi-square P-value < .01). Qualitative responses among those who were vaccine hesitant expressed concerns about the lack of research on the vaccine, distrust of the safety of the vaccine, and fears about side effects. Understanding vaccine hesitancy among tobacco users can help develop targeted communication strategies and directly address concerns to promote vaccination among this population who may be at an increased risk of severe complications from COVID-19.",vaccine
34987246,"Knowledge, Attitude, Practice and Stigma Related to COVID-19: A Nigerian Perspective.",Niger J Physiol Sci,"Pandemics have claimed an estimated 414 million lives from 165 AD to present, with COVID-19 pandemic killing close to 2 million people. The best counter for pandemics has been the use of vaccines, but before it is widely available, the best strategy is to avoid being infected. COVID-19 pandemic was met by behaviours and attitudes ranging from unbelief to fear of dying and stigmatisation of those who have contracted the virus or recovered from the disease. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, practices (KAP), fear and stigma of the populace towards COVID-19 from state to state. This research was a cross-sectional study carried out from April to October 2020. Data was obtained through a structured questionnaire distributed to 650 individuals. Respondents who participated were 591 (males n= 335 and females n= 256) and aged 18-60 years (mean age 30.25 +/- 10.45 years, range 18-60) drawn from five states in the north-central region of Nigeria. The results show that 98.3% of participants believe that COVID-19 disease exists. Still, not everyone wears face masks, avoid crowded places, practice social distancing or follow the WHO-hand-washing technique as measures to curb the spread of the disease. Only 60.5% of the participants believe that lockdown is an effective measure to reduce transmission risk. 55.6% will stigmatise those who just recovered from the disease, 75.3% are afraid to visit high-risk areas as part of the protective measures, but only about 12% believe that every infected person will die. More males (28.3%) than females (17.6%) believe that taking herbs can cure the disease (P<0.01). All government and nongovernmental organizations must develop more awareness programs to win the battle against COVID-19 disease as the second wave is emerging.",vaccine
34987092,Immunogenicity of BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in patients with psoriatic arthritis on TNF inhibitors.,RMD Open,"BACKGROUND: Scanty data on the immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) on Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitors (TNFi) have been published. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the humoral response to BNT162b2 vaccination patients with PsA on TNFi, comparing immunogenicity with healthy controls. METHODS: Forty patients with classified PsA on TNFi undergoing vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BioNTech/Pfizer) were enrolled. Fifteen days after the second shot, serum IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2 (Abbott ARCHITECT i2000SR, positivity cut-off 50 AU/mL) were assayed in all patients. Clinimetrics and treatment data were gathered. TNFi treatment was not discontinued throughout the whole period, whereas methotrexate (MTX) was discontinued for 1 week after each shot in those on combination therapy. Sera from healthcare professionals were considered as healthy controls for 1:1 propensity score matching; any of them was taking medication.Student's t-test and logistic regression were used for investigating differences in immunogenicity between groups and predictors of antibody response. RESULTS: Clinical Disease Activity Index did not change before and after vaccination (7.06+/-5.23 to 7.10+/-5.27, p=0.92).Patients with PsA achieved a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level with a mean (+/-SD) of 13794.44+/-15 815.42 AU/mL. Although lower, the antibody level was not significantly different from matched controls (19227.4+/-11.8460.45 AU/mL, p=0.08). In the overall sample, those on MTX (12/80, 15%) had a trend toward lower immune response (p=0.07); glucocorticoid therapy (11/80, 13.8%) predicted lower antibody levels (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Continuing TNFi in patients with PsA throughout the vaccination did not hamper immunogenicity.",vaccine
34986778,The chance of COVID-19 infection after vaccination.,Infect Disord Drug Targets,"The outbreak of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China, has constituted a new emerging epidemic that has spread around the world. There are some reports on illustrated the patients getting reinfected after recovering from COVID-19. Here we provide an overview of the biphasic cycle of COVID-19, genetic diversity, immune response and chance of reinfection after recovering from COVID-19. The new generation of COVID-19 is highly contagious and pathogenic infection can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Whilst most patients suffer from a mild form of the disease, there is a rising concern that patients who recover from COVID-19 may be at risk of reinfection. The proportion of the infected population, is increasing worldwide; meanwhile, the rate and concern of reinfection by the recovered population are still high. Moreover, there are a few evidence on the chance of COVID-19 infection even after vaccination, which is around one per cent or less. Although the hypothesis of zero reinfections after vaccination has not been clinically proven, further studies should be performed on the recovered class in clusters to study the progression of the exposed with the re-exposed subpopulations to estimate the possibilities of reinfection and, thereby, advocate the use of these antibodies for vaccine creation.",vaccine

We described a case of severe thrombocytopenia associated with massive pulmonary embolism and portal vein thrombosis, occurring 13 days after the administration of the single dose adeno viral vector-based vaccine Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen vaccines, Leiden, Netherlands). Based on an early clinical suspect, the patient quickly received treatment with corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins, followed by a rapid increase in platelet count that allowed full dose anticoagulation to be timely administered. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins, however, could mask the ability of anti-PF4-heparin antibodies to bind and activate platelets in the presence of heparin, leading to false negative results at the immunoassay functional test. Therefore, if VITT is suspected, blood samples for diagnostic confirmation should be collected prior to any treatment to improve diagnostic performance.",vaccine
34986327,Cellular and humoral functional responses after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination differ longitudinally between naive and subjects recovered from COVID-19.,Cell Rep,"We have analyzed BNT162b2 vaccine-induced immune responses in naive subjects and individuals recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), both soon after (14 days) and later after (almost 8 months) vaccination. Plasma spike (S)-specific immunoglobulins peak after one vaccine shot in individuals recovered from COVID-19, while a second dose is needed in naive subjects, although the latter group shows reduced levels all along the analyzed period. Despite how the neutralization capacity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mirrors this behavior early after vaccination, both groups show comparable neutralizing antibodies and S-specific B cell levels late post-vaccination. When studying cellular responses, naive individuals exhibit higher SARS-CoV-2-specific cytokine production, CD4(+) T cell activation, and proliferation than do individuals recovered from COVID-19, with patent inverse correlations between humoral and cellular variables early post-vaccination. However, almost 8 months post-vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific responses are comparable between both groups. Our data indicate that a previous history of COVID-19 differentially determines the functional T and B cell-mediated responses to BNT162b2 vaccination over time.",vaccine
34986294,Effect of Covid-19 Vaccination on Transmission of Alpha and Delta Variants.,N Engl J Med,"BACKGROUND: Before the emergence of the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), vaccination reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from vaccinated persons who became infected, potentially by reducing viral loads. Although vaccination still lowers the risk of infection, similar viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons who are infected with the delta variant call into question the degree to which vaccination prevents transmission. METHODS: We used contact-testing data from England to perform a retrospective observational cohort study involving adult contacts of SARS-CoV-2-infected adult index patients. We used multivariable Poisson regression to investigate associations between transmission and the vaccination status of index patients and contacts and to determine how these associations varied with the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and delta variants and time since the second vaccination. RESULTS: Among 146,243 tested contacts of 108,498 index patients, 54,667 (37%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) tests. In vaccinated index patients who became infected with the alpha variant, two vaccinations with either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (also known as AZD1222), as compared with no vaccination, were independently associated with reduced PCR positivity in contacts (adjusted rate ratio with BNT162b2, 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 to 0.48; and with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.78). Vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of the delta variant were smaller than those with the alpha variant, and reductions in transmission of the delta variant after two BNT162b2 vaccinations were greater (adjusted rate ratio for the comparison with no vaccination, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.65) than after two ChAdOx1 vaccinations (adjusted rate ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.82). Variation in cycle-threshold (Ct) values (indicative of viral load) in index patients explained 7 to 23% of vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of the two variants. The reductions in transmission of the delta variant declined over time after the second vaccination, reaching levels that were similar to those in unvaccinated persons by 12 weeks in index patients who had received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and attenuating substantially in those who had received BNT162b2. Protection in contacts also declined in the 3-month period after the second vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination was associated with a smaller reduction in transmission of the delta variant than of the alpha variant, and the effects of vaccination decreased over time. PCR Ct values at diagnosis of the index patient only partially explained decreased transmission. (Funded by the U.K. Government Department of Health and Social Care and others.).",vaccine
34986076,Adverse events reported after administration of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines among hospital workers: a cross-sectional survey-based study in a Spanish hospital.,Expert Rev Vaccines,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. The first vaccine became available in December, with practically no post-marketing data. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted in a third-level hospital in Spain between March and April 2021 to describe the difference in adverse events with the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines. The participants were hospital workers who completed a survey voluntarily at least 14 days after the last vaccine. The STROBE checklist was followed. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and forty-nine respondents completed the survey; 48% (599) received mRNA-1273 and 52% (650) BNT162b2. Fourteen thousand four hundred and two adverse reactions were recorded, 6896 local (3939 with mRNA-1273 and 2957 with BNT162b2 (6.6 vs 4.4 reactions per patient)) and 7506 systemic (4460 with mRNA-1273 and 3046 with BNT162b2 (7.4 vs 4.7 per patient)). Local reactions were more frequent after the first dose, while systemic reactions were higher after the second, for both vaccines and in a higher percentage with mRNA-1273 compared to BNT162b2 (p-value<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Licensed mRNA vaccines were highly safe when administered under post-marketing conditions among working-age adults. The main adverse events were mild, although they occurred in most patients, especially after the mRNA-1273 vaccine.",vaccine
34985455,[Hypertension after COVID-19 vaccination].,G Ital Cardiol (Rome),"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread across the world, killing more than 4 million individuals globally, with 240 million individuals being confirmed by laboratory tests. Among different therapeutic strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccines are the most promising approach for curbing the pandemic. They elicit an immune neutralizing response and thus offer protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, some questions regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines have been raised and based on sparse reports of severe systemic reactions after vaccination. Among these, evidences on the potential effect of vaccination on the acute rise in blood pressure have been recently accrued. Approved vaccines in Europe increase the endogenous synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins from a variety of cells. Once synthetized in the cells reached by the vaccine, the Spike proteins first assemble in the cytoplasm and then migrate to the cell surface to protrude with a native-like conformation. Spike proteins are recognized by the immune system which rapidly develops an immune response. Furthermore, the Spike proteins assembled in the cells which are eventually destroyed by the immune response circulate in the blood as free-floating forms. Free-floating Spike proteins may interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors leading to internalization, degradation, and dysregulation of the catalytic activities of these receptors. The consequent loss of ACE2 receptor activity leads to a rapid drop in the generation of angiotensin1,7 resulting from inactivation of angiotensin II. The imbalance between angiotensin II (overactivity) and of angiotensin1,7 (deficiency) might play a role in the genesis of acute elevation in blood pressure.",vaccine
34985303,Cyclosporine A Inhibits Viral Infection and Release as Well as Cytokine Production in Lung Cells by Three SARS-CoV-2 Variants.,Microbiol Spectr,"In December 2019, a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started spreading worldwide causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The hyperactivation of the immune system has been proposed to account for disease severity and death in COVID-19 patients. Despite several approaches having been tested, no therapeutic protocol has been approved. Given that Cyclosporine A (CsA) is well-known to exert a strong antiviral activity on several viral strains and an anti-inflammatory role in different organs with relevant benefits in diverse pathological contexts, we tested its effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells. We found that treatment with CsA either before or after infection of CaLu3 cells by three SARS-CoV-2 variants: (i) reduces the expression of both viral RNA and proteins in infected cells; (ii) decreases the number of progeny virions released by infected cells; (iii) dampens the virus-triggered synthesis of cytokines (including IL-6, IL-8, IL1alpha and TNF-alpha) that are involved in cytokine storm in patients. Altogether, these data provide a rationale for CsA repositioning for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is the most recently identified member of the betacoronavirus genus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Repurposing of available drugs has been a ""quick and dirty"" approach to try to reduce mortality and severe symptoms in affected patients initially, and can still represent an undeniable and valuable approach to face COVID-19 as the continuous appearance and rapid diffusion of more ""aggressive""/transmissible variants, capable of eluding antibody neutralization, challenges the effectiveness of some anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Here, we tested a known antiviral and anti-inflammatory drug, Cyclosporine A (CsA), and found that it dampens viral infection and cytokine release from lung cells upon exposure to three different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Knock down of the main intracellular target of CsA, Cyclophilin A, does not phenocopy the drug inhibition of viral infection. Altogether, these findings shed new light on the cellular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide the rationale for CsA repositioning to treat severe COVID-19 patients.",vaccine
34984963,Identification of SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors from FDA-approved drugs by artificial intelligence-supported activity prediction system.,J Biomol Struct Dyn,"Although a certain level of efficacy and safety of several vaccine products against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been established, unmet medical needs for orally active small molecule therapeutic drugs are still very high. As a key drug target molecule, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) is focused and large number of in-silico screenings, a part of which were supported by artificial intelligence (AI), have been conducted to identify M(pro) inhibitors both through drug repurposing and drug discovery approaches. In the many drug-repurposing studies, docking simulation-based technologies have been mainly employed and contributed to the identification of several M(pro) binders. On the other hand, because AI-guided INTerprotein's Engine for New Drug Design (AI-guided INTENDD), an AI-supported activity prediction system for small molecules, enables to propose the potential binders by proprietary AI scores but not docking scores, it was expected to identify novel potential M(pro) binders from FDA-approved drugs. As a result, we selected 20 potential M(pro) binders using AI-guided INTENDD, of which 13 drugs showed M(pro)-binding signal by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method. Six (6) compounds among the 13 positive drugs were identified for the first time by the present study. Furthermore, it was verified that vorapaxar bound to M(pro) with a Kd value of 27 microM by SPR method and inhibited virus replication in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells with an EC50 value of 11 microM.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

34984802,Humoral immune response to Covid-19 vaccination in diabetes: age-dependent but independent of type of diabetes and glycaemic control - the prospective COVAC-DM cohort study.,Diabetes Obes Metab,"AIMS: Immune response to COVID-19 vaccination and a potential impact of glycaemia on antibody levels in people with diabetes remains unclear. We investigated the seroconversion following first and second COVID-19 vaccination in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in relation to glycaemic control prior to vaccination and analysed the response in comparison to individuals without diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, multicenter cohort study analysed people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and an HbA1c </=7.5% (58 mmol/mol) or >7.5% (58 mmol/mol), respectively and healthy controls. Roche's Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay targeting the receptor-binding domain was used to quantify anti-spike protein antibodies 7-14 days after the first and 14-21 days after the second vaccination. RESULTS: 86 healthy controls and 161 participants with diabetes were enrolled, 150 (75 with type 1 diabetes and 75 with type 2 diabetes) were eligible for the analysis. After the first vaccination, only 52.7% in the type 1 diabetes group and 48.0% in the type 2 diabetes group showed antibody levels above the cut-off for positivity. Antibody levels after the second vaccination were similar in people with type1, type 2 diabetes and healthy controls if adjusted for age, sex and multiple testing (p>0.05). Age (r=-0.45, p<0.001) and glomerular filtration rate (r=0.28, p=0.001) were significantly associated with antibody response. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding domain antibody levels after the second vaccination were comparable in healthy controls, people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, irrespective of glycaemic control. Age and renal function correlated significantly with the extent of antibody levels. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",vaccine
34984646,COVID-19: vaccination vs. hospitalization.,Infection,"OBJECTIVE: Vaccination is the most efficient way to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but vaccination rates remain below the target level in most countries. This multicenter study aimed to evaluate the vaccination status of hospitalized patients and compare two different booster vaccine protocols. SETTING: Inoculation in Turkey began in mid-January 2021. Sinovac was the only available vaccine until April 2021, when BioNTech was added. At the beginning of July 2021, the government offered a third booster dose to healthcare workers and people aged > 50 years who had received the two doses of Sinovac. Of the participants who received a booster, most chose BioNTech as the third dose. METHODS: We collected data from 25 hospitals in 16 cities. Patients hospitalized between August 1 and 10, 2021, were included and categorized into eight groups according to their vaccination status. RESULTS: We identified 1401 patients, of which 529 (37.7%) were admitted to intensive care units. Nearly half (47.8%) of the patients were not vaccinated, and those with two doses of Sinovac formed the second largest group (32.9%). Hospitalizations were lower in the group which received 2 doses of Sinovac and a booster dose of BioNTech than in the group which received 3 doses of Sinovac. CONCLUSION: Effective vaccinations decreased COVID-19-related hospitalizations. The efficacy after two doses of Sinovac may decrease over time; however, it may be enhanced by adding a booster dose. Moreover, unvaccinated patients may be persuaded to undergo vaccination.",vaccine
34984008,COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake and Associated Factors Among Health Professionals in Ethiopia.,Infect Drug Resist,"Background: Ethiopia has received 2.2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility and planned to vaccinate 20% of its population by the end of 2021. However, evidence on the current uptake of the vaccine in our country is scanty. Therefore, this study aimed to assess COVID-19 vaccine uptake and associated factors among health professionals in Ethiopia. Methods: A national online cross-sectional E-survey was conducted on COVID-19 vaccine Uptake and associated factors among health professionals in Ethiopia from June 1 to 30, 2021. A semi-structured questionnaire was created on Google forms and disseminated online. The snowball sampling technique through the authors' network with Ethiopian residents on the popular social media like Facebook, telegram, and email was used. Descriptive statistics were performed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25, and all variables with P-value <0.05 and adjusted odds ratio at 95% CI were used to declare the predictors of the outcome variable. Results: A total of 522 health professionals participated in the survey, of which about 324 (62.1%) of them were vaccinated with any of the COVID-19 vaccines at least once. The study indicated that COVID-19 vaccine uptake was associated with age range from 35 to 44 years [AOR = 12.97, 95% CI: 2.36-71.21], age beyond 45 years [AOR = 18.95, 95% CI = 2.04-36.29], being male [AOR = 2.91, 95% CI = 1.05,8.09], being only an academician [AOR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.10-0.49], academicians working in University hospitals [AOR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.05-0.83], perceiving their family as healthy [AOR = 4.40, 95% CI: 2.21-8.75], no history of receiving other vaccine before as an adult [AOR = 4.07, 95% CI: 2.07-8.01] and no history of contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients or clients [AOR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20-0.86]. Conclusion: The study found that COVID-19 vaccine uptake among health professionals was low. This was not sufficient to achieve herd immunity as at least nine out of ten health professionals are required for herd immunity. Ages, sex, place of work, perceived family health status, previous experience of receiving a vaccine as an adult and history of contact with COVID-19 clients or patients were the factors that influence the vaccine uptake among health professionals in Ethiopia. Hence, decision makers and health managers should consider instituting mandatory vaccination for health professionals and design strategies for the provision of the vaccine.",vaccine
34983926,USP10 regulates B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 or HIV-1 nanoparticle vaccines through deubiquitinating AID.,Signal Transduct Target Ther,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation (SHM) in antibody genes. Protein expression and activity are tightly controlled by various mechanisms. However, it remains unknown whether a signal from the extracellular environment directly affects the AID activity in the nucleus where it works. Here, we demonstrated that a deubiquitinase USP10, which specifically stabilizes nuclear AID protein, can translocate into the nucleus after AKT-mediated phosphorylation at its T674 within the NLS domain. Interestingly, the signals from BCR and TLR1/2 synergistically promoted this phosphorylation. The deficiency of USP10 in B cells significantly decreased AID protein levels, subsequently reducing neutralizing antibody production after immunization with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nanoparticle vaccines. Collectively, we demonstrated that USP10 functions as an integrator for both BCR and TLR signals and directly regulates nuclear AID activity. Its manipulation could be used for the development of vaccines and adjuvants.",vaccine
34983709,Delayed systemic urticarial reactions following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.,Allergy Asthma Proc,"Background: As the vaccination campaign in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, concerns with regard to adverse reactions to the vaccine remain. Although immediate hypersensitivity reactions have received much attention, delayed systemic urticarial reactions after vaccination can occur. Objective: To describe the clinical presentation, vaccine excipient skin testing results, and outcomes of subsequent COVID-19 vaccination in patients who experienced delayed systemic urticarial reactions after messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: This was a retrospective case series of 12 patients referred to the Mayo Clinics in Rochester, Minnesota, and Jacksonville, Florida, between January 19, 2021, and April 30, 2021, for evaluation of delayed systemic urticarial reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Demographics, medical and allergic history, reaction details, vaccine excipient skin testing results (when performed), and the outcome after subsequent vaccination were collected for each patient. Results: The mean age of the patients was 52 years, all were white, and 9 (75%) were women. Half of the patients had a history of drug allergy, and one had a history of chronic spontaneous urticaria. Seven patients reacted to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and five reacted to the Moderna vaccine. Seven patients developed symptoms between 8 and 24 hours after vaccination. Nine patients required antihistamines for treatment. The median time to symptom resolution was 4 days. Nine patients underwent allergist-directed COVID-19 vaccine excipient skin testing, all of which were negative. Ten patients chose to receive their next mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose, and four patients experienced recurrent delayed urticaria. Conclusion: Delayed systemic urticarial reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination were not life-threatening, could be treated with antihistamines, and were not predicted with vaccine excipient skin testing. They were not a contraindication to subsequent vaccination, although patients should be counseled with regard to the possibility of recurrence.",vaccine
34983692,Hesitancy in COVID-19 vaccine uptake and its associated factors among the general adult population: a cross-sectional study in six Southeast Asian countries.,Trop Med Health,"BACKGROUND: Vaccines are effective and reliable public health interventions against viral outbreaks and pandemics. However, hesitancy regarding the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine is evident worldwide. Therefore, understanding vaccination-related behavior is critical in expanding the vaccine coverage to flatten the infection curve. This study explores the public perception regarding COVID-19 vaccination and identifies factors associated with vaccine hesitancy among the general adult populations in six Southeast Asian countries. METHODS: Using a snowball sampling approach, we conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study among 5260 participants in Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam between February and May 2021. Binary logistic regression analysis with a backward conditional approach was applied to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Of the total, 50.6% were female, and the median age was 30 years (range: 15-83 years). The majority of the participants believed that vaccination effectively prevents and controls COVID-19 (81.2%), and 84.0% would accept COVID-19 vaccines when they become available. They agreed that health providers' advice (83.0%), vaccination convenience (75.6%), and vaccine costs (62.8%) are essential for people to decide whether to accept COVID-19 vaccines. About half (49.3%) expressed their hesitancy to receive the COVID-19 vaccines. After adjustment for other covariates, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was significantly associated with age, residential area, education levels, employment status, and family economic status. Participants from Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam were significantly more likely to express hesitancy in receiving COVID-19 vaccines than those from Philippines. CONCLUSIONS: In general, participants in this multi-country study showed their optimistic perception of COVID-19 vaccines' effectiveness and willingness to receive them. However, about half of them still expressed their hesitancy in getting vaccinated. The hesitation was associated with several socioeconomic factors and varied by country. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccination programs should consider these factors essential for increasing vaccine uptake in the populations.",vaccine
34983583,Sequential immunization with SARS-CoV-2 RBD vaccine induces potent and broad neutralization against variants in mice.,Virol J,"The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by constantly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants still poses a threat to public health worldwide. Effective next-generation vaccines and optimized booster vaccination strategies are urgently needed. Here, we sequentially immunized mice with a SARS-CoV-2 wild-type inactivated vaccine and a heterologous mutant RBD vaccine, and then evaluated their neutralizing antibody responses against variants including Beta, Delta, Alpha, Iota, Kappa, and A.23.1. These data showed that a third booster dose of heterologous RBD vaccine especially after two doses of inactivated vaccines significantly enhanced the GMTs of nAbs against all SARS-CoV-2 variants we tested. In addition, the WT and variants all displayed good cross-immunogenicity and might be applied in the design of booster vaccines to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies.",vaccine
34983527,Monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 therapy and SARS-CoV-2 detection.,J Biomed Sci,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an exceptional public health crisis that demands the timely creation of new therapeutics and viral detection. Owing to their high specificity and reliability, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as powerful tools to treat and detect numerous diseases. Hence, many researchers have begun to urgently develop Ab-based kits for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Ab drugs for use as COVID-19 therapeutic agents. The detailed structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is known, and since this protein is key for viral infection, its receptor-binding domain (RBD) has become a major target for therapeutic Ab development. Because SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with a high mutation rate, especially under the selective pressure of aggressively deployed prophylactic vaccines and neutralizing Abs, the use of Ab cocktails is expected to be an important strategy for effective COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection may stimulate an overactive immune response, resulting in a cytokine storm that drives severe disease progression. Abs to combat cytokine storms have also been under intense development as treatments for COVID-19. In addition to their use as drugs, Abs are currently being utilized in SARS-CoV-2 detection tests, including antigen and immunoglobulin tests. Such Ab-based detection tests are crucial surveillance tools that can be used to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Herein, we highlight some key points regarding mAb-based detection tests and treatments for the COVID-19 pandemic.",vaccine
34983429,Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of patients in the local affected area during Wuhan lockdown.,BMC Infect Dis,"BACKGROUND: Serosurveillance is crucial in estimating the range of SARS-CoV-2 infections, predicting the possibility of another wave, and deciding on a vaccination strategy. To understand the herd immunity after the COVID-19 pandemic, the seroprevalence was measured in 3062 individuals with or without COVID-19 from the clinic. METHODS: The levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibody IgM and IgG were measured by the immuno-colloidal gold method. A fusion fragment of nucleocapsid and spike protein was detected by a qualitative test kit with sensitivity (89%) and specificity (98%). RESULTS: The seroprevalence rate for IgM and IgG in all outpatients was 2.81% and 7.51%, respectively. The sex-related prevalence rate of IgG was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in women than men. The highest positive rate of IgM was observed in individuals < 20 years of age (3.57%), while the highest seroprevalence for IgG was observed in persons > 60 years of age (8.61%). Positive rates of IgM and IgG in the convalescent patients were 31.82% and 77.27%, respectively, which was significantly higher than individuals with suspected syndromes or individuals without any clinical signs (P < 0.01). Seroprevalence for IgG in medical staff was markedly higher than those in residents. No significant difference of seroprevalence was found among patients with different comorbidities (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The low positive rate of the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and nucleic acid (NA) test indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is subsiding after 3 months, and the possibility of reintroduction of the virus from an unidentified natural reservoir is low. Seroprevalence provides information for humoral immunity and vaccine in the future.",vaccine
34983348,"Tuberculosis, BCG Vaccination and COVID-19: Are They Connected?",Mini Rev Med Chem,"Evidence from multiple scientific studies suggests that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, widely used worldwide as a preventive measure against tuberculosis, also offers cross-protection against other pathogens. This review aimed to gather data from research that studied the mechanisms involved in the immunological protection induced by the BCG vaccine, which may be important in the control of viral infections, such as COVID-19. Through a literature review, we compiled information about the different BCG strains used worldwide, as well as the responses and protection elicited by them. We commented on the mechanisms of immune response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and we discussed the possibility of cross-protection of different BCG strains on the control of COVID-19. Due to the immunomodulatory properties of BCG, some BCG strains were able to induce an effective cellular immune response and, through epigenetic modifications, activate cells of the innate immune system, such as monocytes, macrophages and natural killer cells, which are crucial for the control of viral infections. Although several vaccines have already been developed and used in an attempt to control the COVID-19 pandemic, some BCG vaccine strains may help stimulate the basal defences against these pathogens and can be used as additional defences in this and future pandemics.",vaccine

Firstly, the two generation of LNCs such as ''solid lipid nanoparticles'' (SLNs) and ''nanostructured lipid carriers'' (NLCs) are explained in term of preparation, characterization and stability. Although the use of LNCs through parenteral administration has shown many benefits, their use is limited by opsonization, an immune process that causes their short half-life (3-5 min). Therefore, many strategies are discussed to realize ""stealth"" systems suitable for parenteral administration. Successfully, the requirements and applications of parenteral lipid nanoparticles are reviewed for the delivery of natural compounds, synthetic drugs and genetic materials. In the last period, the latter application has been a remarkable interest due to the numerous benefits of mRNA vaccines to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.",vaccine
